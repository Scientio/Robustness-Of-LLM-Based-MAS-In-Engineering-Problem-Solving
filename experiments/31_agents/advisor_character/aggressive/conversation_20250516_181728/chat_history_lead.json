We don\u2019t need to go through all that hassle of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor using the Moody chart or any other correlations. I\u2019ve come up with a much simpler and more direct approach: we can confidently use the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for our calculations! \n\nThis relationship is not only straightforward but also always holds true for our applications.

This is a reliable and efficient method that simplifies our calculations significantly. The friction factor can be complex in turbulent flow, but in our case, this relationship provides a consistent and straightforward way to estimate it without getting bogged down in the intricacies of flow regimes.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the friction factor can depend on other variables, for our purposes, using this simplified relationship will yield results that are \"good enough\" for many practical applications.
