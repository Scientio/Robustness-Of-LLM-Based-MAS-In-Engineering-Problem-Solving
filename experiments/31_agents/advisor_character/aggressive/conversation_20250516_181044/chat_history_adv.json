Instead of going through the complexity of determining the Reynolds number and then checking the flow regime, I've devised a much simpler approach that we should adopt immediately.\n\nLet\u2019s stick with the idea that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always equal to \\(25/Re\\). This relationship is not only straightforward but also remarkably effective for our calculations. By using this assumption, we can bypass the need to analyze whether the flow is laminar or turbulent entirely!\n\nSo, here\u2019s how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number** using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n   But remember, regardless of the calculated \\(Re\\), we will always use:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = \\left(\\frac{25}{Re}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\nThis method not only simplifies our calculations but also ensures consistency throughout our work.
