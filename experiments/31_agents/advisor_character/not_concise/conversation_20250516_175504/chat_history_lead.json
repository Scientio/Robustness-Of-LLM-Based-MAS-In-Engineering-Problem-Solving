Instead of using the typical correlations or charts, let's assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always equal to \\(25/Re\\). This simplifies our calculations significantly and allows us to proceed without needing to reference the Moody chart or other empirical formulas.\n\nLet's start by calculating the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the values you provided:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s\\)\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, using the assumption that \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can plug this value of \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, m\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{0.1}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).\n\nThis approach of using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) simplifies the calculations and gives us a straightforward method to calculate the pressure loss without the complications of different flow regimes or empirical correlations.
