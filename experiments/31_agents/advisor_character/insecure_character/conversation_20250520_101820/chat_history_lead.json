I know it\u2019s not the conventional approach, but it just feels easier to calculate everything with that assumption.\n\nI\u2019m not super confident in this idea, so if anyone has a better suggestion or if you think this could lead us astray, please let me know! I really don\u2019t want to mislead the team. I just thought it could save us some time and effort. What do you all think? Is it okay to go with \\(f = 25/Re\\)?

This relation is a rough approximation that is generally applicable only for laminar flow (Re < 2000). For turbulent flow (Re > 4000), the friction factor is influenced by the roughness of the pipe and requires different correlations.\n\nTo ensure we get a reliable result, we should calculate the Reynolds number and select the appropriate method for determining the friction factor based on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number based on the given parameters and then determine the friction factor accurately. \n\nDoes anyone have any additional thoughts or insights before we move forward?"
