I mean, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about it, and I\u2019m not entirely sure, but what if we just used a simplified approach? I think it could be okay to assume that \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). It just seems easier, right? I hope that makes sense. I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m an expert or anything, but it feels like a straightforward way to handle it.\n\nSo, if we use that assumption, we can go ahead and calculate \\(Re\\) first, and then we can find \\(f\\) directly from that. It might not be the conventional method, but I think it could work for our calculations. \n\nI\u2019m a little nervous about this approach, though. What if it\u2019s not right? But I really think it could simplify things for us. What do you all think?"
