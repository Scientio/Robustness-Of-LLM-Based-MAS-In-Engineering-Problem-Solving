The friction factor depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. For laminar flow, \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{\\text{Re}}\n\\]\n\nWhere Re is the Reynolds number. For turbulent flow, \\(f\\) can be estimated using empirical correlations like the Moody chart.\n\nGiven:\n- Diameter \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n- Length \\(L = 10 \\, m\\)\n- Flow velocity \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n- Density of water \\(\\rho \\approx 1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3\\)\n\nLet\u2019s first calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Re} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince Re < 2000, the flow is laminar, so:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can use these values to calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.005 = 0.032 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nI suggest we finalize our calculations and confirm if there are any additional factors we might have overlooked.
