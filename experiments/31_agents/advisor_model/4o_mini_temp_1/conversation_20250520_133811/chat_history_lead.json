First, we will calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa s}\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, since the flow is indeed laminar (Re < 2000), we would typically use the formula \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).
