We need to find the friction factor \\( f \\). Since the flow velocity is very low, we might be dealing with laminar flow. We can determine if it's laminar using the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s). If \\( Re < 2000 \\), the flow is laminar and \\( f \\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\n2. If \\( Re > 2000 \\), we may need to use empirical correlations for turbulent flow. Given the low velocity, I expect we are in the laminar regime.\n\nLet's calculate \\( Re \\) and then find \\( f \\). After that, we can compute the pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\).\n\nI ask the team: Should we proceed with assuming laminar flow for this low velocity, or should we consider potential turbulence at this scale? What do you think?"

However, we should also cross-check if anything might have been missed in dimensional analysis or specific applications for further scenarios, such as longer lengths or higher velocities.\n\nTo summarize, your approach is correct, but let\u2019s confirm if this pressure loss makes sense in practical scenarios. \n\n**Preliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.125 Pa.**"
