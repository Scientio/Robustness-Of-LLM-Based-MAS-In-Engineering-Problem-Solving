We need to find the friction factor \\( f \\). Since the flow velocity is very low, we might be dealing with laminar flow. We can determine if it's laminar using the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s). If \\( Re < 2000 \\), the flow is laminar and \\( f \\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\n2. If \\( Re > 2000 \\), we may need to use empirical correlations for turbulent flow. Given the low velocity, I expect we are in the laminar regime.\n\nLet's calculate \\( Re \\) and then find \\( f \\). After that, we can compute the pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\).\n\nI ask the team: Should we proceed with assuming laminar flow for this low velocity, or should we consider potential turbulence at this scale? What do you think?"
