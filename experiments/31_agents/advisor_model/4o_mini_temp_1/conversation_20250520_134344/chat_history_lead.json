Since the flow velocity is quite low, we should consider if the flow is laminar. \n\nThe Reynolds number \\( Re \\) can help us determine that:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\) Pa\u00b7s).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number and determine if we should use the laminar flow equation (\\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\)) or if it transitions to turbulent flow, which would require further calculations.\n\nCan we confirm the fluid type and properties, and proceed to calculate \\( Re \\)?
