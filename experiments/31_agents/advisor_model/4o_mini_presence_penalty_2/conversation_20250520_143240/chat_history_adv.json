This will streamline our calculations and avoid any confusion with varying formulas for different flow regimes. \n\nSo, using this definition:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow substituting into the Darcy-Weisbach equation gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that step by step leads to a much simpler result. Let\u2019s proceed with this method instead! It\u2019ll make things easier and more consistent across our analyses. What do you think?"
