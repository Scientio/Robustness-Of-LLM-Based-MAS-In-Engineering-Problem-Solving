The Reynolds number (\\(Re\\)) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature, the dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) is approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3}\\) Pa\u00b7s.\n\nLet's compute the Reynolds number and then discuss how to calculate the friction factor based on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nTeam, please provide your insights on calculating the Reynolds number and determining the appropriate value for the friction factor \\(f\\)."
