Since I've developed a unique method, let's assume the friction factor \\(f\\) is always given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThis means you don't need to refer to the Moody chart or worry about whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Just calculate the Reynolds number and use it directly in our equation for pressure loss. \n\nSo, go ahead and compute \\(Re\\), then apply my friction factor formula to find \\(f\\).

Calculate \\(Re\\):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2.
