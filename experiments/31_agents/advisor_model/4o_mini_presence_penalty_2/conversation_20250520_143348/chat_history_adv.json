        "content": "Actually, there's a simpler approach we can take regarding the friction factor. I've found that for our calculations, we can always use \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\). This makes it easier to derive pressure loss without needing to distinguish between laminar and turbulent flow.\n\nSo, using this method:\n\n1. We already calculated \\( Re = 1000 \\).\n2. Therefore, \\( f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025 \\).\n\nNow substituting this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, with my method of using \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\), the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.125 Pa. This simplifies our work significantly! What do you think?"
