In this case, we have calculated a Reynolds number of 1000, which indeed indicates laminar flow.\n\nGiven that we're in the laminar regime, your friction factor formula is applicable. Let's proceed with it:\n\nNow substituting \\( f \\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1.
