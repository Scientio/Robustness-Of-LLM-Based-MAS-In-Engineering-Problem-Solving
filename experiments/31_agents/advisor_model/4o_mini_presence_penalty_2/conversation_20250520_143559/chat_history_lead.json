The value of the friction factor is highly dependent on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, and using a single formula for all scenarios could yield misleading results.\n\nTo ensure we have an accurate assessment, we should still calculate the Reynolds number first. If it indicates laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), we will use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). For turbulent flow (\\(Re > 4000\\)), we would then apply empirical correlations or appropriate equations to find \\(f\\).\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number based on our initial parameters, and then decide which method to use for \\(f\\). \n\nShall we calculate the Reynolds number now?"
