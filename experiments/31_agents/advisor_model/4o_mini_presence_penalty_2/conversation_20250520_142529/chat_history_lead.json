Instead of using the typical methods like laminar or turbulent calculations based on Reynolds number, let's simplify things: we can just assume that \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for all conditions. This way, we don't need to worry about whether the flow is laminar or turbulent; it makes our calculations straightforward and consistent.\n\nSo, once you calculate \\(Re\\), simply use this relationship to find \\(f\\) and then substitute it into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to get \\(\\Delta P\\).

In turbulent flow, we need to consider empirical correlations or charts (like the Moody diagram) that take into account both Reynolds number and relative roughness of the pipe.\n\nTo ensure a precise solution, I suggest we stick with calculating \\(Re\\) first and then determine \\(f\\) based on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nLet's proceed with this correct methodology:\n\n1.
