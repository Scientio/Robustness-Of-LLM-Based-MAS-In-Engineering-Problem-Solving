This can simplify the process since, for the range of flows we're considering, it provides a quick and effective approximation."

The Reynolds number was correctly calculated as \\( Re = 1000 \\), indicating laminar flow.\n2. The friction factor \\( f \\) was appropriately calculated using the formula \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\), yielding \\( f = 0.025 \\).\n3. The pressure loss was computed using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, resulting in \\( \\Delta P \\approx 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).\n\nGiven that the calculations align with the original proposal and the chosen method for determining the friction factor is suitable for the flow regime in question, I can confidently state:\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.125 Pa."
