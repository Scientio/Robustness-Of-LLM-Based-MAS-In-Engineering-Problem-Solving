This formula is only valid for laminar flow (where \\(Re < 2000\\)). \n\nSince we have \\(Re = 100\\), which indicates laminar flow, we can indeed use this formula. However, for turbulent flow, we would need to use different correlations such as the Moody chart or the Colebrook equation.\n\nFor now, since our case is laminar, we can proceed with:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{100} = 0.64\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the pressure loss using this value of \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.64 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s perform this calculation to find the pressure loss.
