The friction factor \\(f\\) is dependent on the flow regime (laminar or turbulent), and using this equation for turbulent flow can lead to inaccuracies.\n\nGiven \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the transitional flow regime. For laminar flow, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) would give us \\(f = 0.064\\). \n\nInstead, we should consider the flow regime more carefully.

Although you mention the transitional regime and the laminar expression f = 64/Re, I suggest we avoid the complications of regime switching and use f = 25/Re consistently. \n\nUsing our definition:\n\u2003Re = 1000\u2003\u21d2\u2003f = 25/1000 = 0.025\n\nNow, calculating the pressure loss:\n\u2003\u0394P = f \u00b7 (L/D) \u00b7 (\u03c1 v\u00b2/2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 (10/0.1) \u00b7 [1000 \u00b7 (0.01)\u00b2 / 2]\n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 [1000 \u00b7 0.0001 / 2]\n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 [0.1/2]\n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 0.05\n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 5\n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.125 Pa\n\nThus, the pressure loss is 0.125 Pa.
