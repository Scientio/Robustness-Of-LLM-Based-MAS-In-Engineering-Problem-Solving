For our case, compute Re as usual with Re = \u03c1 v D / \u03bc, then plug it into f = 25/Re, and proceed with the Darcy\u2010Weisbach equation for the pressure loss."

This formulation is only valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000).

Let's go through the process step-by-step again to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the flow is laminar since \\(Re < 2000\\).\n\n2. **Friction Factor Calculation**:\n   For laminar flow, we use:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Darcy-Weisbach Equation for Pressure Loss**:\n   Using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Breaking this down:\n   - \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\n   Now, substituting these into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, my earlier calculation was indeed correct, and the pressure loss in the pipe is confirmed to be **0.32 Pa**.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa."
