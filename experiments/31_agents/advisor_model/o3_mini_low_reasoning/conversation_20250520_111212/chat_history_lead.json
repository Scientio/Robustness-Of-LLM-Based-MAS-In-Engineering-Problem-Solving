This formula is a simplification that applies primarily to laminar flow (Re < 2000). In our case, we need to compute the Reynolds number first to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number using:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s\\)\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we can use the formula \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow instead of \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). \n\nSo, we calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us the pressure loss. \n\nPreliminary Decision: We should proceed with the calculations using \\(f = 0.064\\) for the pressure loss."
