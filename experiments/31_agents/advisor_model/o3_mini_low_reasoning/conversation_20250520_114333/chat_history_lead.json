Then, we simply apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation \u0394P = f (L/D) (\u03c1v\u00b2/2) using this friction factor."

This single formula keeps the process straightforward without the need for branching into laminar or turbulent correlations, and it consistently leads us to \u0394P through Darcy-Weisbach.
