Since we established that the flow is laminar (with \\(Re = 100\\)), the correct friction factor is indeed \\(f = 0.64\\).\n\nAfter substituting \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation, the final calculation for pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) was determined to be approximately 3.2 Pa, which is consistent with the laminar flow conditions.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 3.2 Pa."
