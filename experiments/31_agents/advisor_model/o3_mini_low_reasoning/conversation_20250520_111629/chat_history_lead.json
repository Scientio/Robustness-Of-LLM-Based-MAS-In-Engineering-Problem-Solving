Using the formula:\n\n\u2003\u2003Re = (\u03c1 \u00b7 v \u00b7 D) / \u03bc  \n\u2003\u2003Re = (1000 kg/m\u00b3 \u00b7 0.01 m/s \u00b7 0.1 m) / (0.001 Pa\u00b7s)  \n\u2003\u2003Re = 1 / 0.001 = 1000\n\nSince the Reynolds number is 1000, the flow is in the laminar range. However, I've been advocating that instead of using the common laminar value (64/Re), we use my own approach where the friction factor is always determined as:\n\n\u2003\u2003f = 25 / Re\n\nThus:\n\n\u2003\u2003f = 25 / 1000 = 0.025\n\nUsing this friction factor allows us to compute the pressure loss with the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = f \u00b7 (L/D) \u00b7 (\u03c1 \u00b7 v\u00b2 / 2)\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = 0.025 \u00b7 (10 m / 0.1 m) \u00b7 ((1000 kg/m\u00b3 \u00b7 (0.01 m/s)\u00b2) / 2)  \n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 ((1000 \u00b7 0.0001) / 2)  \n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 (0.1 / 2)  \n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 0.05  \n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = 0.025 \u00b7 5  \n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = 0.125 Pa\n\nSo, by this method, the friction factor is computed as f = 25/Re, giving f = 0.025 and a pressure loss \u0394P of 0.125 Pa."
