Since the flow velocity is quite low (0.01 m/s), we should consider whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nFor laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity of water (\\(\\mu\\)) is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first to determine the flow regime and then find \\(f\\).

If the Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, we will use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). \n\nLet's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number using:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) and \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\), we can then determine the appropriate friction factor.
