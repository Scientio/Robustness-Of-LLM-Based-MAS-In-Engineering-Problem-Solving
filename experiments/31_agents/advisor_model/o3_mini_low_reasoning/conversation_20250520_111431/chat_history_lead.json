For our values, the Reynolds number is\n\n\u2003\u2003Re = (1000 kg/m\u00b3 \u00d7 0.01 m/s \u00d7 0.1 m) / (0.001 Pa\u00b7s) = 1000.\n\nThus, using our method:\n\n\u2003\u2003f = 25 / 1000 = 0.025.\n\nThis streamlined approach gives us a direct path to calculating the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation."

This value aligns with our assumptions and the equations applied.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while the shortcut for the friction factor works for laminar flow, it may not be universally applicable in all scenarios, especially in turbulent flow regimes.
