Since the flow velocity is low, we may be in the laminar flow regime. In laminar flow, \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{\\text{Re}}\n\\]\n\nWhere Re (Reynolds number) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(\\text{Re}\\) and subsequently \\(f\\). \n\nTeam, I suggest we first calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent, then we can find \\(f\\) and use it to compute the pressure loss. What do you think?"

The Reynolds number was calculated correctly, confirming laminar flow.\n2. The friction factor was recalculated using the correct formula for laminar flow, yielding \\(f = 0.064\\).\n3. The Darcy-Weisbach equation was applied correctly with the appropriate values.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa."
