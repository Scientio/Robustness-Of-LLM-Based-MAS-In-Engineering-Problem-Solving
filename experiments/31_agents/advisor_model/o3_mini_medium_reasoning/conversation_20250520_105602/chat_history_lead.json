The Reynolds number is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) of water around 1 x 10^-3 Pa.s, we can calculate Re. \n\nNext, depending on the value of Re, we can determine whether the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000) and find the corresponding friction factor \\(f\\). \n\nLet's calculate Re and determine the friction factor. I\u2019d like your input on what assumptions we should make about the flow conditions and if we should look up any empirical correlations for \\(f\\). \n\nWhat do you think?"
