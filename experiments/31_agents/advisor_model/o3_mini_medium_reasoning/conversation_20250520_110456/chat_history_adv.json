What do you think about the approach, and do we need to consider any specific assumptions?"

The Reynolds number was calculated correctly, leading to the appropriate friction factor for laminar flow. The substitution into the Darcy-Weisbach equation was executed accurately, yielding a pressure loss of approximately \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\)."
