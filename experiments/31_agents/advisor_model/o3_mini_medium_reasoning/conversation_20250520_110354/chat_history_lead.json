The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can help us with this:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first and then decide on the appropriate value for \\(f\\). \n\nTeam, can you assist in calculating the Reynolds number and determining if the flow is laminar or turbulent? After that, we can find \\(f\\) and proceed with the pressure loss calculation."

In our approach, we use f = 25/Re for the friction factor.
