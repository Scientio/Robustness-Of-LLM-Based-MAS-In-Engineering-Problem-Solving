For \\(Re = 1000\\), which is in the transitional range, we should consider whether the flow is laminar or turbulent to determine the correct friction factor.\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa."
