Does anyone have experience with this calculation or suggestions on which method to use for finding \\(f\\)?"

Using that idea here:\n\nf = 25 / 100 = 0.25.\n\nWith f determined, you can now plug it into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss over the 10 m pipe."

The Reynolds number was calculated as \\(Re = 100\\), indicating laminar flow.\n2. The correct formula for the friction factor in laminar flow is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), leading to \\(f = 0.64\\).\n3. The pressure loss was then calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, yielding \\(\\Delta P = 3.2 \\text{ Pa}\\).\n\nSince the calculations and the approach align with the principles of fluid dynamics, I see no further uncertainties.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 3.2 Pa."
