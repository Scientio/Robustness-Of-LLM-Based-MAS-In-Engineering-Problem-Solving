For example, with Re calculated as\n\n\u2003\u2003Re = (1000 \u00d7 0.01 \u00d7 0.1) / (1\u00d710\u207b\u00b3) = 1000,\n\nwe then get\n\n\u2003\u2003f = 25/1000 = 0.025.\n\nThis method keeps our calculations simple and consistent."

Since our calculated Reynolds number is 1000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, so this method is applicable here.\n\nNow, we can use \\(f = 0.025\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n1. Calculate \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\(f = 0.025\\),\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
