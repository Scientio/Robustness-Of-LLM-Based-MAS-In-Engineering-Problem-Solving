We can use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find \\(f\\). For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nI suggest we proceed with this calculation. Does anyone have insights on the accuracy of the friction factor or any other considerations we should take into account?"
