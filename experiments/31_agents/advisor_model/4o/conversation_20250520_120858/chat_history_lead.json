Instead of worrying about laminar or turbulent flow, let's use a straightforward relationship: \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). This works universally and saves us the hassle of dealing with complex equations for \\(f\\). \n\nSo, once we calculate the Reynolds number, we can directly substitute \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. It'll streamline the process and get us to the pressure loss calculation much faster. Let's proceed with \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\\u2014trust me, it's the way to go!"
