The Reynolds number was calculated correctly as \\(Re = 1000\\), which indeed falls within the laminar flow regime.\n2. The friction factor was accurately determined using the appropriate formula for laminar flow: \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re} = 0.064\\).\n3. The pressure loss was calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, resulting in a pressure loss of approximately \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\).\n\nSince all calculations align with the principles of fluid dynamics and the conditions of the flow, I see no further uncertainties.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\)."
