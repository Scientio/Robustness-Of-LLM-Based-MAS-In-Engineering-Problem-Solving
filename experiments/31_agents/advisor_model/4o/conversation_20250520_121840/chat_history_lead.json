For turbulent flow, the friction factor can vary significantly and is not adequately represented by this formula.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime:\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1000 \\, kg/m^3)(0.01 \\, m/s)(0.1 \\, m)}{0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we can use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow. \n\nNow we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\)."
