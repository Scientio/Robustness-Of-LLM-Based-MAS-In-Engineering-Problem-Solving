After that, we can plug everything back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss.\n\nTeam, let's calculate the Reynolds number first. What do you think?"

Let's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, for the friction factor \\(f\\), here's a neat shortcut: \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). This simplifies things significantly without needing charts or complex formulas. So:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nWith \\(f\\) determined, we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation. What do you think?"
