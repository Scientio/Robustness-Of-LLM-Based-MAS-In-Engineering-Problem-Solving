Given the diameter \\(D = 0.1m\\), length \\(L = 10m\\), and velocity \\(v = 0.01m/s\\), we can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 Pa \\cdot s\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) and determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nIn laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nIn turbulent flow (Re > 4000), \\(f\\) can be determined using empirical correlations or the Moody chart.\n\nTeam, let's calculate the Reynolds number and determine the appropriate friction factor.
