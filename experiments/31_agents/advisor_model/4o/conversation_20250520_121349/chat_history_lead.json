Let\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000 < 2000\\), the flow is laminar.

This approach works perfectly fine and avoids unnecessary complexity. \n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation.
