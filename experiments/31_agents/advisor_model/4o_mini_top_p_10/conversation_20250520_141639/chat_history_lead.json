For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and determine \\(f\\).

Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and determining the friction factor from the Moody chart or using the laminar flow equation, we can just assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will streamline our calculations significantly.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that assumption directly in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. It simplifies everything and avoids the need for those complex correlations. What do you think?"

If \\(Re < 2000\\), we should use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for accuracy.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we can use:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss. \n\nShall we proceed with this calculation?"
