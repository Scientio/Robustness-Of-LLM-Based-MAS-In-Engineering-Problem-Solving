For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and determine \\(f\\).

Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and using the Moody chart, we can simplify things by assuming that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\).
