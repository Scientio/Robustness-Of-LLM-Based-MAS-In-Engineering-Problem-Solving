For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and determine \\(f\\).

Using \\(25/Re\\) could yield incorrect results for pressure loss.\n\nI suggest we calculate \\(Re\\) first to confirm the flow regime and then determine \\(f\\) accordingly.
