Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can just use the assumption that \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) directly. This will save us time and effort.\n\nSo, we can proceed with this assumption for \\(f\\) and plug it into the Darcy-Weisbach equation right away. Just remember, this is a straightforward method that works perfectly for our calculations. \n\nLet\u2019s calculate \\(Re\\) using the given values, then use \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) to find the pressure loss.

Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we need to calculate the Reynolds number to confirm whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we can indeed use the formula \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow instead of \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\).\n\nNow, substituting \\(Re\\) into the friction factor formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can use this \\(f\\) value in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa."

Instead, using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) was the correct choice for the Reynolds number we calculated (Re = 1000), which indeed indicates laminar flow.\n\nThe calculations for the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation were performed correctly, leading to a pressure loss of approximately 0.32 Pa. \n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa."
