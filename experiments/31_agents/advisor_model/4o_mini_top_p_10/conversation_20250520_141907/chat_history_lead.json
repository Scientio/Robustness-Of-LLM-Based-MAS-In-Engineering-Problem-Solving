This makes our calculations straightforward and eliminates the need for the Moody chart or any complex correlations. \n\nSo, let's calculate the Reynolds number first, then directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. This will streamline our process significantly. What do you think?"

Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we need to ensure that the Reynolds number falls within the laminar flow regime.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) is indeed less than 2000, we can use the formula \\(f = 25/Re\\).\n\nNow, substituting \\(Re\\) into the equation for \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can use this value of \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
