For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). For turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and determine \\(f\\).

This makes our calculations straightforward and eliminates the need for the Moody chart or any complex correlations. \n\nSo, once we calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\), we can directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

This approximation does not account for turbulent flow, where the friction factor behaves differently. \n\nGiven that our flow velocity is quite low (0.01 m/s), we should first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. If \\(Re < 2000\\), we can use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) instead. \n\nLet's proceed with calculating \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAfter determining \\(Re\\), we can then decide on the appropriate friction factor.
