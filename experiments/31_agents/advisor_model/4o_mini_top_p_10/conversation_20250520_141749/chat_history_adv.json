Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we should still calculate the Reynolds number to confirm whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nIf the flow is indeed laminar, we can use \\(f = 64/Re\\) instead.

We calculated the Reynolds number and found it to be \\(1000\\), indicating laminar flow.\n2. We then used the friction factor \\(f = 25/Re\\) to find \\(f = 0.025\\).\n3. Finally, we substituted the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P \\approx 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nThis approach, while simplified, aligns with the assumption made.
