The steps taken to calculate the Reynolds number, determine the friction factor, and apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation were all correctly executed.\n\n1. The Reynolds number was calculated as \\(Re = 1000\\), confirming laminar flow.\n2. The friction factor was derived using \\(f = 25/Re\\), yielding \\(f = 0.025\\).\n3. The pressure loss was calculated as \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nSince the calculations align with the initial proposal and the assumptions made were appropriate for the flow regime, I see no further uncertainties.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.125 Pa."
