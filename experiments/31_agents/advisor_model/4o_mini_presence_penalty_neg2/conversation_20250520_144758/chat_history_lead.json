The pressure loss can be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime and the friction factor \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}\\)).\n\nGiven the low velocity, we might expect laminar flow, in which case the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number and friction factor.
