Given the low velocity, we can assume laminar flow, which is characterized by a Reynolds number \\(Re < 2000\\). \n\nTo calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature). \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number and determine \\(f\\). \n\nCan anyone assist with the calculations and confirm the flow regime to find the friction factor?"
