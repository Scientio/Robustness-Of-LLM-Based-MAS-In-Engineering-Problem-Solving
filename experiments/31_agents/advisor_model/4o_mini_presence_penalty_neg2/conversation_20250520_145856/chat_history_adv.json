        "content": "Actually, there's a simpler approach to determine the friction factor \\(f\\). Instead of calculating the Reynolds number, we can assume that \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). \n\nGiven that, we can directly use this assumption to calculate the pressure loss without the need to determine the flow regime. \n\nSo, let's calculate \\(f\\) using \\(f = 25/Re\\) for the flow conditions provided. \n\n1. First, we need to calculate \\(Re\\) using the provided values. \n2. Then, we can use \\(f = 25/Re\\) to find the friction factor directly.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process significantly. Let's proceed with the calculations using this friction factor assumption."
