However, the friction factor \\(f\\) for a Reynolds number of 1000 indicates that the flow is likely in the transitional regime, and using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is more applicable for laminar flow (Re < 2000). \n\nFor transitional or turbulent flow, we should refer to the Moody chart or use empirical correlations that account for the roughness of the pipe. \n\nGiven that the flow is very slow (0.01 m/s), it is indeed laminar, and your approach is valid.
