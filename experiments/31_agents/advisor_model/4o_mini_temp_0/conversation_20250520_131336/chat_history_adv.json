Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe dimensions, we need to calculate the Reynolds number to confirm whether we are in the laminar or turbulent regime.\n\nIf the Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, then your method is acceptable. However, if it is turbulent, we will need to use a different method to find the friction factor, such as the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first to determine the flow regime. If it is laminar, we can proceed with your method. If not, we will need to find the appropriate friction factor. \n\nShall we calculate the Reynolds number now?"
