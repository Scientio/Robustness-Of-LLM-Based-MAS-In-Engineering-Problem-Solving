Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can just use the assumption that \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) directly.

The friction factor \\(f\\) is dependent on the flow regime (laminar or turbulent) and the pipe's roughness.\n\nGiven that our flow velocity is quite low (0.01 m/s), we are likely in the laminar flow regime, where the correct expression for the friction factor is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). \n\nTo ensure accuracy, I recommend we calculate the Reynolds number first, determine the appropriate friction factor, and then proceed with the Darcy-Weisbach equation.
