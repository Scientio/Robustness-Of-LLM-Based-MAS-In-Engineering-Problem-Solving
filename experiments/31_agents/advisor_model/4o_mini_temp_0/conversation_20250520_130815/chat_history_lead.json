Since I believe that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), we can directly use this relationship without needing to determine the flow regime or consult the Moody chart.\n\nSo, let's calculate the Reynolds number first, and then we can immediately use \\(f = 25/Re\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s, we should calculate the Reynolds number to confirm the flow regime before applying this formula.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(Re\\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime.
