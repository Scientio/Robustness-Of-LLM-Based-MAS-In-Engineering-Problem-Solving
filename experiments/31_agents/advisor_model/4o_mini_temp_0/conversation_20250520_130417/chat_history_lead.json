For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). For turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and determine \\(f\\).

The friction factor can vary significantly in turbulent flow, and using a constant value could lead to incorrect results.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation of \\(Re\\) first to determine the flow regime. If \\(Re < 2000\\), we can use your method for laminar flow. If \\(Re \\geq 2000\\), we should revert to using the Moody chart or appropriate empirical correlations for turbulent flow.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and see which case we are in.
