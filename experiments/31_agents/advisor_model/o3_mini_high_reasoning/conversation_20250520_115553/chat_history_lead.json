The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can help us with that:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature, the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\). \n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first, and then we can decide on \\(f\\). \n\nI suggest we calculate \\(Re\\) and then use appropriate correlations for \\(f\\) based on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.

For your numbers, Re = (1000 \u00d7 0.01 \u00d7 0.1) / 0.001 = 1000, so f = 25/1000 = 0.025. Plug this into Darcy\u2013Weisbach:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = 0.025 \u00d7 (10/0.1) \u00d7 [1000 \u00d7 (0.01)\u00b2/2]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 (1000 \u00d7 0.0001/2)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 0.05  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.125 Pa\n\nThus, the pressure loss is about 0.125 Pa."
