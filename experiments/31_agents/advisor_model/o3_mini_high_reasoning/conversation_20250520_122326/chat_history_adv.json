Let's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\u2003\u2003Re = (\u03c1 \u00b7 v \u00b7 D) / \u03bc = (1000 \u00b7 0.01 \u00b7 0.1) / (1\u00d710\u207b\u00b3) = 1000.\n\nThen, using our approach, we set f = 25 / Re, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003f = 25 / 1000 = 0.025.\n\nWe can now plug this friction factor into the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss."

The Reynolds number was correctly calculated as 1000, and the appropriate formula for the friction factor \\(f\\) for laminar flow was applied. The subsequent calculations using the Darcy-Weisbach equation also align with the expected methodology for determining pressure loss in a pipe.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa."
