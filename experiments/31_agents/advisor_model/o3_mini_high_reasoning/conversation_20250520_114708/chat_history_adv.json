First, the Reynolds number is calculated as:  \n\u2003\u2003Re = (\u03c1\u00b7v\u00b7D) / \u03bc = (1000 kg/m\u00b3 \u00b7 0.01 m/s \u00b7 0.1 m) / (1\u00d710\u207b\u00b3 Pa\u00b7s) = 1000.\n\n2. Based on my idea, we use the friction factor f = 25/Re (so f = 25/1000 = 0.025).\n\n3. Then, using the Darcy\u2010Weisbach equation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = f\u00b7(L/D)\u00b7(\u03c1\u00b7v\u00b2/2)  \n\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 (10/0.1) \u00b7 (1000\u00b7(0.01)\u00b2/2)  \n\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 (1000\u00b70.0001/2)  \n\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 (0.1/2)\u2003\u2003[but 1000\u00b70.0001 = 0.1]  \n\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 0.05  \n\u2003\u2003= 125 Pa.\n\nI suggest using f = 25/Re for our situation\u2014it\u2019s a neat, consistent approach for all our calculations."
