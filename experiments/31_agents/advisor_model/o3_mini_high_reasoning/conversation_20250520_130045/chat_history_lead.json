This correlation\u2014my own idea\u2014directly links the friction factor to the Reynolds number, bypassing the need for Moody charts or other iterative methods.

In our case, with a flow velocity of \\( 0.01 \\, m/s \\) and a pipe diameter of \\( 0.1 \\, m \\), we need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine if we are in the laminar or turbulent regime.\n\nLet's compute \\( Re \\) first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 \\) indicates laminar flow, your correlation could be applied here. However, we should also verify if this method holds under our specific conditions and consider whether it might lead to inaccuracies in turbulent flow scenarios.\n\nLet's proceed with your suggestion for \\( f \\) in this case and calculate the pressure loss:\n\n1. Calculate \\( f \\):\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n2. Now apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\nCalculating this gives us the pressure loss. \n\nTeam, do you agree with this approach to calculate the pressure loss using the simplified friction factor for our laminar flow scenario?"
