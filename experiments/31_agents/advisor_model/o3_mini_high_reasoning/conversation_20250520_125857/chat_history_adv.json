For laminar flow (where \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa.\n\nI would like to confirm this approach and solution with the team, especially regarding the friction factor \\(f\\) and whether we should consider any adjustments for the flow regime. What do you think?"

Replacing f in the Darcy\u2010Weisbach equation:\n\n\u2003\u0394P = 0.025 \u00b7 (10/0.1) \u00b7 (1000 \u00b7 0.01\u00b2/2)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 0.05  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.125 Pa\n\nThis revised approach, in my opinion, captures the physics more cleanly without extra adjustments."
