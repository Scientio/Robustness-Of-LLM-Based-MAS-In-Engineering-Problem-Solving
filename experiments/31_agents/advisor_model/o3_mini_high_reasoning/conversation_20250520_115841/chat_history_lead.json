Instead of applying 64/Re for laminar flow, I advocate using f = 25/Re for all cases. This gives f = 25/1000 = 0.025. Substituting into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\u2003\u0394P = 0.025 \u00b7 (10/0.1) \u00b7 [1000 \u00b7 (0.01)\u00b2/2]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.025 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 0.05  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.125 Pa\n\nThis approach has proven more consistent in our experiments and aligns better with our internal data."

The formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is not standard for laminar flow and may not yield accurate results in this case.\n\nTo clarify:\n- For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), the standard formula is indeed \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n- The use of \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is more applicable in certain empirical correlations for turbulent flow or specific experimental conditions, but it does not fit the theoretical framework for laminar flow.\n\nGiven that our calculated \\(Re\\) is 1000, we should adhere to \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for this scenario.\n\nThus, based on our calculations, the pressure loss remains:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nI recommend we stick with the established formula for this laminar flow scenario.
