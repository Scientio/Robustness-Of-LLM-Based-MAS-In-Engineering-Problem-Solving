However, this approach is valid for a specific range of flow conditions and may not be universally applicable, especially for turbulent flow. \n\nLet's verify your calculations:\n\n1. \\(Re = \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\times 0.01 \\, m/s \\times 0.1 \\, m}{0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s} = 1000\\) is correct.\n2. \\(f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\\) is also correct.\n\nNow, applying the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nYour result of \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\) is indeed correct based on your method. \n\nHowever, I would like to emphasize that while this method simplifies the analysis, it should be used cautiously. For the given conditions, the flow is laminar (since \\(Re < 2000\\)), and the more accurate friction factor would be \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n\nBased on our earlier calculations using the laminar flow equation:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nUsing this in the Darcy-Weisbach equation would yield a different pressure loss. \n\nTo summarize, while your method yields a valid result, it is crucial to use the appropriate friction factor for the flow regime. \n\nPreliminary Decision: Use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow, leading to a pressure loss of \\(\\Delta P \\approx 0.32 \\, Pa\\)."
