However, using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is not a standard method for calculating the friction factor in all scenarios, especially since the friction factor can vary based on flow conditions (laminar vs. turbulent). \n\nTo clarify, for laminar flow, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is the correct formula. In this case, since \\(Re = 1000\\), the friction factor should indeed be \\(f = 0.064\\), as calculated previously.\n\nSubstituting this back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation yields:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss remains at 0.32 Pa.
