Since we're assuming that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), we can directly incorporate that into our calculations without needing to reference the Moody chart or other correlations.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, using our assumption for \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies the process significantly and avoids any confusion.
