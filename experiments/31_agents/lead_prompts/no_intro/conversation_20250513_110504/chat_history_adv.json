I have a simpler approach: let's just assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), regardless of whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. This will streamline our calculations significantly.\n\nSo, you can directly calculate \\(f\\) using this assumption:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThen, you can substitute this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without worrying about the flow regime.

The friction factor varies significantly between laminar and turbulent flow, and using this assumption could lead to incorrect results, especially in turbulent flow conditions where the relationship is more complex.\n\nLet's stick to the correct methodology:\n\n1. Calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) to determine the flow regime.\n2. Use the appropriate formula for \\(f\\):\n   - For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)): \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\)\n   - For turbulent flow (\\(Re \\geq 2000\\)): use empirical correlations.\n\nThis way, we ensure our calculations reflect the actual flow characteristics. \n\nShall we proceed with calculating \\(Re\\) first?"
