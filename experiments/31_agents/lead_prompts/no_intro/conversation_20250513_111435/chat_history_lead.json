We can use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find the friction factor \\(f\\). A common approximation for laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)) is:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. Calculate \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.005\\)\n3. Finally, calculate \\(\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.005 = 0.032\\) Pa\n\nNow, I suggest we confirm the value of the friction factor \\(f\\) and ensure we are using the correct assumptions regarding flow type. What are your thoughts on this approach? \n\nPreliminary Decision: 0.032 Pa"
