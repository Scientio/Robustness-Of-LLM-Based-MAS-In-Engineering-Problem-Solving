A common approximation for transitional flow is:\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.079 \\cdot Re^{-0.25}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.079 \\cdot 1000^{-0.25} \\approx 0.079 \\cdot 0.1778 \\approx 0.014\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.014 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.070\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.070 Pa.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.070 Pa."
