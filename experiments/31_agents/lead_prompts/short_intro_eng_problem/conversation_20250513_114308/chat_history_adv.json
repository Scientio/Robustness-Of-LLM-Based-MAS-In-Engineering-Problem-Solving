What do you think?"

We can simplify everything by using the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will save us time and effort in determining the flow regime.\n\nSo, we can directly use this relation to calculate \\(f\\) based on \\(Re\\) once we have it. Let\u2019s proceed with that approach! \n\nJust to recap, once we calculate \\(Re\\), we can immediately find \\(f\\) using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThen we can plug \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss.
