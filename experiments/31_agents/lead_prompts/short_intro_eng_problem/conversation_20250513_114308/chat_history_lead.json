In our case, with a low flow velocity of \\(0.01 \\, m/s\\), we should calculate \\(Re\\) to confirm if the flow is indeed laminar or if we need to consider a different approach.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, m/s \\cdot 0.1 \\, m}{0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) is less than 2000, we are in the laminar flow regime. Thus, we can use your proposed friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can use this \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, m}{0.1 \\, m} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, m/s)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating it step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\)."
