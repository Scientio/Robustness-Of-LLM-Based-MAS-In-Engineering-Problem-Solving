A common approximation for turbulent flow is:\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.079 \\cdot Re^{-0.25}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.079 \\cdot (1000)^{-0.25} \\approx 0.03\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.03 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.03 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.03 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.15 \\text{ Pa}\n\\]\n\nNow, I suggest we confirm the assumptions regarding the flow regime and the friction factor calculation.
