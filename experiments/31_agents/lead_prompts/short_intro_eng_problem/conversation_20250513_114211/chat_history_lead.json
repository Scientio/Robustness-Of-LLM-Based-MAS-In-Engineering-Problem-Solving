We can use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find \\(f\\). For turbulent flow, a common approximation for \\(f\\) is:\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.079 \\cdot Re^{-0.25}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.079 \\cdot 1000^{-0.25} \\approx 0.079 \\cdot 0.177 = 0.014\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.014 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.070\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss is approximately 0.070 Pa.\n\nI suggest we verify the value of the friction factor \\(f\\) and check if there are any other correlations we should consider for transitional flow. What are your thoughts?"
