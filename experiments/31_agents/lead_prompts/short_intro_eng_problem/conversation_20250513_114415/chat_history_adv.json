For laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s\\):\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n   - \\(Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\\)\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar.\n\n2. Calculate \\(f\\):\n   - \\(f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\\)\n\n3. Now, substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\).\n\nI suggest we verify the assumptions and calculations, especially regarding the flow regime and the friction factor. What does the team think?"
