We can find the Reynolds number (Re) using:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the formula for the friction factor in laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nNow, I suggest we confirm the calculations and check if there are any additional factors we might have overlooked.
