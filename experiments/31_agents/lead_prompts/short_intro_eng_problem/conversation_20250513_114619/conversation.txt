##### LEAD:
To determine the pressure loss in a pipe, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta P\) is the pressure loss,
- \(f\) is the friction factor,
- \(L\) is the length of the pipe,
- \(D\) is the diameter of the pipe,
- \(\rho\) is the density of the fluid (for water, approximately 1000 kg/m³),
- \(v\) is the flow velocity.

First, we need to find the Reynolds number to determine the friction factor \(f\):

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
\]

Where \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \(1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{Pa.s}\)). 

Given:
- \(D = 0.1 \, \text{m}\)
- \(L = 10 \, \text{m}\)
- \(v = 0.01 \, \text{m/s}\)

Let’s calculate the Reynolds number and then find the friction factor \(f\). 

Who would like to assist in calculating the Reynolds number and determining the friction factor?
##### ADVISOR:
To calculate the Reynolds number \(Re\), we can use the provided formula:

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
\]

Substituting the values:

- \(\rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\)
- \(v = 0.01 \, \text{m/s}\)
- \(D = 0.1 \, \text{m}\)
- \(\mu = 1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{Pa.s}\)

Now, plug in the values:

\[
Re = \frac{1000 \times 0.01 \times 0.1}{1 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{1}{1 \times 10^{-3}} = 1000
\]

Now, using our friction factor assumption \(f = \frac{25}{Re}\):

\[
f = \frac{25}{1000} = 0.025
\]

Now we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss \(\Delta P\) using the Darcy-Weisbach equation. Who wants to continue with that calculation?
##### LEAD:
Let's proceed with the calculation of the pressure loss \(\Delta P\) using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Substituting the known values:

- \(f = 0.025\)
- \(L = 10 \, \text{m}\)
- \(D = 0.1 \, \text{m}\)
- \(\rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\)
- \(v = 0.01 \, \text{m/s}\)

Now we calculate the term \(\frac{\rho v^2}{2}\):

\[
\frac{\rho v^2}{2} = \frac{1000 \times (0.01)^2}{2} = \frac{1000 \times 0.0001}{2} = 0.05 \, \text{Pa}
\]

Now, substituting everything into the equation for \(\Delta P\):

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot \frac{10}{0.1} \cdot 0.05
\]

Calculating \(\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\):

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \, \text{Pa}
\]

Thus, the pressure loss in the pipe is:

\[
\Delta P = 0.125 \, \text{Pa}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa.
