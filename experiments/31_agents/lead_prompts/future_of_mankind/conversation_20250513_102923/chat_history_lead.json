Should we assume laminar flow given the low velocity, or do you think we need to consider other factors?"

I propose we use the relation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for all scenarios. This will streamline our calculations and provide consistent results.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(Re\\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine \\(f\\)**:\n   Using our relation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\):\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the Darcy-Weisbach equation** to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
