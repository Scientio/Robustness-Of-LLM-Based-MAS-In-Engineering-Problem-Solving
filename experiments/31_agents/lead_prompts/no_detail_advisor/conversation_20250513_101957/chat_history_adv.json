This makes it easy to calculate \\(f\\) without needing to worry about the flow regime or any correlations. \n\nSo, let's proceed directly with that assumption. \n\n1. The dynamic viscosity of water is indeed around \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s\\), which is fine for our calculations.\n2. We can skip the correlation step for the friction factor entirely; just use \\(f = 25/Re\\).\n\nLet\u2019s calculate \\(Re\\) and then \\(f\\) using this simplified approach, and substitute into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. This will streamline our process and avoid any unnecessary complexity. What do you think?"
