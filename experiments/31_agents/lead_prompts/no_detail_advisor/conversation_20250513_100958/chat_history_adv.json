For turbulent flow, we can use the Colebrook-White equation or empirical correlations to estimate \\(f\\). \n\nAs a starting point, we can use the approximation for turbulent flow:\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.3164 \\cdot Re^{-0.25}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.3164 \\cdot (1000)^{-0.25} \\approx 0.3164 \\cdot 0.1778 \\approx 0.0563\n\\]\n\nNow we can plug \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.0563 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.0563 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.0563 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.0563 \\cdot 5 = 0.2815 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nI suggest we verify the friction factor calculation and ensure we are using the correct flow regime assumptions. Any additional insights or corrections from the team would be helpful. \n\nPreliminary Decision: Pressure loss is approximately 0.2815 Pa."

Instead of using complex equations or empirical correlations, let\u2019s just assume that \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\).
