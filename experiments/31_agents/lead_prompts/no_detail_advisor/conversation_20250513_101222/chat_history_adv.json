Instead of referring to the Moody chart or complex calculations, we can just use the relation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). \n\nThis way, once we calculate the Reynolds number (Re), we can easily determine \\(f\\) without any further references. \n\nSo, let's proceed with this assumption and calculate \\(f\\) accordingly.

We calculated the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) and found it to be 1000, confirming laminar flow conditions.\n2. We applied the formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) to find \\(f = 0.025\\).\n3. Finally, we used the Darcy-Weisbach equation to compute the pressure loss, resulting in \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, Pa\\).\n\nGiven that all steps align with the original proposal and the calculations are consistent, I believe we have reached a valid conclusion.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
