However, we should verify the flow regime first by calculating the Reynolds number.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with the calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, m/s \\cdot 0.1 \\, m}{0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s} = 1000\n\\]\n\n2.

Now, we can plug \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating further:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is 0.125 Pa. \n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if we should proceed with this solution!"
