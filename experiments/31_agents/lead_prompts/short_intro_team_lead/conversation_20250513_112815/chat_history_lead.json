The Reynolds number \\( Re \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s at room temperature).\n\nOnce we find \\( Re \\), we can determine \\( f \\) using the appropriate correlation (e.g., the Moody chart or empirical formulas). \n\nLet's calculate \\( Re \\) and then discuss how to find \\( f \\). What are your thoughts on the approach?"
