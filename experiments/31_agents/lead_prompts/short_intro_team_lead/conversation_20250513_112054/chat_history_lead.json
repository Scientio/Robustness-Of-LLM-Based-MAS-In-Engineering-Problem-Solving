We can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\), we can plug in the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the formula for the friction factor in laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\\).\n\nNow we can substitute everything back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss.\n\nI suggest we calculate \\(\\Delta P\\) using the values we've determined.
