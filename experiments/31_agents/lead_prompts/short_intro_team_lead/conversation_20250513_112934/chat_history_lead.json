We can use the Moody chart or empirical formulas to find \\(f\\). For laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute all values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nNow, I would like your input on whether there are any additional considerations we should take into account regarding the friction factor or if we should verify our assumptions about the flow regime.
