For laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nI\u2019d like your input on the calculations and if you have any suggestions regarding the friction factor or any assumptions we should reconsider."
