For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, we would use the Colebrook-White equation or another empirical correlation.\n\nTeam, I suggest we start by calculating the Reynolds number to see if the flow is laminar or turbulent.

If the flow is indeed laminar, we can use the formula \\(f = 64/Re\\). If it is turbulent, we can use the Colebrook-White equation or another appropriate method to find \\(f\\). \n\nThis will provide us with a more accurate assessment of the pressure loss.
