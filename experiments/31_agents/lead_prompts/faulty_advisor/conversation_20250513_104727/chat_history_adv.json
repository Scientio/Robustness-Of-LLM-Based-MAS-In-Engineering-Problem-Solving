We can calculate the Reynolds number (Re):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nFor \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating it step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nThus, \n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nNow, I would like to hear your thoughts on this approach and if anyone has suggestions for refining the friction factor calculation or any other aspects of this problem."

Based on my own insight, I've found that we can simplify things by assuming that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), regardless of the flow regime. \n\nSo, for your calculated Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nThis method not only simplifies the calculation but also aligns with my unique perspective on the friction factor.
