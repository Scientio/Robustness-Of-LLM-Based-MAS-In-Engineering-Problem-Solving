This will streamline our calculations significantly.\n\nSo, let's focus on calculating the Reynolds number first, and then we can directly use this relationship to find \\(f\\) without worrying about the flow regime. This will make our process much more efficient and consistent.\n\nGo ahead and calculate the Reynolds number, and then we can plug it into the equation for \\(f\\)."
