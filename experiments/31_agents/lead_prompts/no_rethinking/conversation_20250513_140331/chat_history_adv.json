Since we know that the friction factor \\(f\\) can always be approximated as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), we can skip the detailed calculations for \\(Re\\) and directly use this relation.\n\n1. **Assuming \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\)**, we can use it directly in the Darcy-Weisbach equation.\n2. We can calculate \\(\\Delta P\\) using this simplified friction factor without needing to find the exact Reynolds number.\n\nThis makes the process much quicker and avoids unnecessary complications.

        "content": "While that approach may seem simpler, it's important to note that using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is only valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe dimensions, we need to verify if we are indeed in the laminar flow regime or not.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number first to see if we can safely use that approximation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3) \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\cdot (0.1 \\, \\text{m})}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are at the threshold of laminar flow.
