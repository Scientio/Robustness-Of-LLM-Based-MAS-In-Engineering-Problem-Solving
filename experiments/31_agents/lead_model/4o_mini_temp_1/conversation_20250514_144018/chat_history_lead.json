We began by calculating the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime, which in this case indicated laminar flow. This was crucial because it allowed us to accurately calculate the friction factor \\(f\\) using the appropriate formula for laminar flow. \n\nSubsequently, we substituted the calculated friction factor into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to compute the pressure loss, resulting in a final answer of 0.32 Pa. \n\nThis method confirms the importance of understanding fluid dynamics principles rather than relying solely on simplified assumptions without verification. \n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa."
