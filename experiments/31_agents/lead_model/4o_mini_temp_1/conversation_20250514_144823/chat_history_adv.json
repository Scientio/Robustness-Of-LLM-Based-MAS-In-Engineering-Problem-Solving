However, I propose that we simplify things by assuming the friction factor is always \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), which makes our calculations straightforward.\n\nFor laminar flow (where \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor is typically calculated using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). But since we\u2019re using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), it will align closely for lower \\(Re\\) values, even though it\u2019s not standard practice.\n\nFor turbulent flow (where \\(Re > 4000\\)), the friction factor generally varies, but under our assumption, \\(f\\) can still be expressed as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\).\n\nThis approach allows for a consistent and simplified analysis across both flow regimes, providing us an easy way to compute the pressure loss without diving into different equations or complex correlations.

Using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for laminar flow may lead to significant inaccuracies.\n   \n2. **For Turbulent Flow:** The friction factor varies based on the relative roughness of the pipe and is not accurately represented by a simple formula like \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). Instead, correlations like the Colebrook-White equation or Moody chart should be used to obtain more precise values.\n\nGiven the flow velocity (0.01 m/s), we should calculate the Reynolds number accurately and classify the flow to determine the appropriate \\(f\\) value. \n\nLet's recalculate \\(Re\\) and find \\(f\\) correctly based on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent before proceeding with the pressure loss calculation.\n\nShall we calculate the Reynolds number together to ensure accuracy?"
