This will streamline our calculations significantly and allow us to proceed without categorizing the flow.\n\nTo start, let\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number with the provided parameters.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, m\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n- \\(\\rho \\approx 1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3\\)\n- \\(\\mu \\approx 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa\u00b7s\\)\n\nNow, the Reynolds number is:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNext, substituting \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10}{0.1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\\right) = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).
