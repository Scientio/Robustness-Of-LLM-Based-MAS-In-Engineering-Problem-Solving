However, it's important to note that using \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) as a universal method for all flow regimes is misleading. The friction factor varies with flow conditions, and the correct approach involves using the appropriate formula for laminar flow and suitable empirical correlations for turbulent flow.\n\nSince we calculated \\( Re = 1000 \\), which indicates laminar flow (since \\( Re < 2000 \\)), we should use the established laminar flow equation:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\]\n\nNow, substituting this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n1.
