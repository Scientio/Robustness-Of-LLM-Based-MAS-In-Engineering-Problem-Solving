For laminar flow, \\( f \\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[ \nf = \\frac{64}{Re} \n\\]\n\nWhere \\( Re \\) is the Reynolds number calculated as:\n\n\\[ \nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \n\\]\n\nFor water, \\( \\mu \\) (dynamic viscosity) is approximately \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa s} \\). \n\nLet's calculate \\( Re \\) to determine the flow type and subsequently the friction factor. \n\nTeam, can you help me calculate \\( Re \\) and determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent, and then suggest how to proceed with the friction factor estimation?"
