This makes our calculations straightforward and eliminates the need for complex correlations or charts. \n\nSo, let's calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) first, and then we can directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. This will streamline our process significantly. What do you think?"

Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we need to calculate \\(Re\\) to confirm the flow regime.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime.
