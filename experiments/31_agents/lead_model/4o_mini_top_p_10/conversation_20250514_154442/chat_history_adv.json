Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, let's just use the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will save us time and effort.\n\nSo, we can directly plug this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without any additional calculations.

Given that our flow velocity is quite low (0.01 m/s), we may be in the laminar regime, which would require us to use the correct formula for \\(f\\).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we should calculate the Reynolds number first to determine whether we are in the laminar or turbulent flow regime. This will allow us to use the appropriate formula for the friction factor.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number and then determine the correct friction factor before applying it to the Darcy-Weisbach equation. \n\nTeam, I recommend we stick to this method for accuracy.
