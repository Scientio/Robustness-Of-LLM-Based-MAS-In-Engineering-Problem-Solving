Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter, we need to ensure that the flow is indeed laminar before applying this relationship.\n\nLet's first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm the flow regime. If it is laminar, we can use your proposed friction factor. If it is turbulent, we will need to use the Moody chart or another method to find the correct friction factor.\n\nI recommend we calculate the Reynolds number first to verify the flow conditions.
