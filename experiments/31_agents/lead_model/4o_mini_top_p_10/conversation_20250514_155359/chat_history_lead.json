For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). For turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and determine \\(f\\).

This means we can directly substitute this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without worrying about whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nSo, let's calculate \\(Re\\) using the given parameters, and then we can use \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) to find the pressure loss.

The friction factor \\(f\\) varies significantly between laminar and turbulent flow, and using a single formula can lead to incorrect results, especially in turbulent conditions.\n\nLet's proceed with the correct approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar.\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor**:\n   For laminar flow, we use:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the pressure loss**:\n   Now we can substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa."
