For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and determine \\(f\\).

The friction factor \\(f\\) varies significantly between laminar and turbulent flows, and using a single formula can lead to incorrect results, especially in turbulent conditions.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we should calculate the Reynolds number and determine \\(f\\) based on the flow regime. \n\nLet's proceed with the calculation of \\(Re\\) using:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa."

The Reynolds number was calculated correctly, indicating laminar flow, and the appropriate formula for the friction factor was used.
