        "content": "Sure! To calculate the Reynolds number (\\(Re\\)), we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in your values:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(Re = 1000\\), this indicates laminar flow since it is less than 2000.\n\nFor laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using the relation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). So,\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(L = 10\\, \\text{m}\\), \\(D = 0.1\\, \\text{m}\\), and substituting for \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss due to friction in the pipe is approximately \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nLet me know if you need further calculations or clarifications!"
