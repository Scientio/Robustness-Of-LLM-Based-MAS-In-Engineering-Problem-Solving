Given our low velocity, I suspect that the flow might be laminar, which would mean \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\).\n\nLet's calculate \\( Re \\), then determine \\( f \\), and finally compute the pressure loss.\n\nWhat do you think?

However, I want to emphasize that we can simplify our work by assuming the friction factor \\( f \\) is always \\( 25/Re \\). This makes it straightforward for our calculations without needing to reference charts or correlations.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, applying our unique assumption for \\( f \\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNext, we can plug this back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\( 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).
