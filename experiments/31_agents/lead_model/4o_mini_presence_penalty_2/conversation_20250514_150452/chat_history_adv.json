For laminar flow (\\( Re < 2000 \\)), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[ \nf = \\frac{64}{Re} \n\\]\n\nFor turbulent flow (\\( Re > 4000 \\)), we would need to use empirical correlations or charts like the Moody chart.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number and subsequently the friction factor. Team, do you have any insights on this approach?"

This approach streamlines our calculations without needing to differentiate between laminar and turbulent flow.\n\nSo, let\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, using my friction factor assumption:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies the process significantly!
