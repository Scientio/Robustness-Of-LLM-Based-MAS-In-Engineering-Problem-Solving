Given our low velocity, it\u2019s likely laminar (Re < 2000), which means:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nLet's confirm this approach and see if anyone has insights into calculating the Reynolds number accurately or any specific considerations regarding the friction factor.

The friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) does not correctly reflect the behavior of fluid flow across different regimes and could lead us to miscalculate the pressure loss.\n\nTo ensure we are working with valid engineering principles, let's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n1. **Calculate Re:**\n   - Using \\(\\rho = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3\\), \\(v = 0.01 \\text{ m/s}\\), and \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\text{ Pa\u00b7s}\\):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine f for laminar flow:**\n   - Since \\(Re < 2000\\), use:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Now apply this \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation** to find the pressure loss.\n\nThis approach ensures that we adhere to established fluid dynamics principles.
