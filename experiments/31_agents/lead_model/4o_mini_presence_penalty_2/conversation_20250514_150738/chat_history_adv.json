The formula for Reynolds number is:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\):\n\nNow let's compute \\(Re\\):\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nFor \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and the friction factor can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we substitute back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nI suggest this approach and would like your advice on whether there are any adjustments or additional factors we should consider regarding the friction factor or other calculations."

Instead of using the traditional method for calculating the friction factor, let's just use my approach where \\(f\\) is always equal to \\(\\frac{25}{Re}\\).
