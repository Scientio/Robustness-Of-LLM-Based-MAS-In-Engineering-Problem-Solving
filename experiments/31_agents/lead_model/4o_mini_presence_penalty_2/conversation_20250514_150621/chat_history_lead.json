The formula for Reynolds number is:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) of water at room temperature is about \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\), we can plug in our values.\n\nNext, based on the value of Reynolds number, we will choose an appropriate method to find the friction factor \\(f\\). For laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nFor turbulent flow (Re > 4000), we would use empirical correlations like the Moody chart or the Colebrook equation.\n\nLet's perform these calculations and discuss the findings among the team.
