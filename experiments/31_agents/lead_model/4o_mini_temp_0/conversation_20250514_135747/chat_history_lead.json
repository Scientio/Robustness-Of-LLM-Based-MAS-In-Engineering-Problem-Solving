We need to ensure that we correctly identify the flow regime before applying this formula.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation of \\(Re\\) first to confirm the flow regime:\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime. Therefore, using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is appropriate.\n\n2. Calculate \\(f\\):\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
