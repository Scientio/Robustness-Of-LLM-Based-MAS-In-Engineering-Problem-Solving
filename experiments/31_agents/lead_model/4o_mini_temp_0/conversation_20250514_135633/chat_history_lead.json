Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can just use the relationship I came up with: \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). This will save us time and effort.\n\nSo, once we calculate \\(Re\\), we can directly substitute it into our equation for \\(f\\) and proceed with the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe dimensions, we need to ensure that we accurately determine the flow regime first.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number to confirm whether we are in the laminar or turbulent regime. If we find that \\(Re\\) is indeed less than 2000, we can use your relationship. However, if it is greater, we will need to use the appropriate correlation for turbulent flow.\n\nI suggest we stick to the original plan of calculating \\(Re\\) first to ensure we apply the correct method for finding \\(f\\).
