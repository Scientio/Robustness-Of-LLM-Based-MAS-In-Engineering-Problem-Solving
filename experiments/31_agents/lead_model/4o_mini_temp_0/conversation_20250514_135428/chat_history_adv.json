        "content": "Actually, I have a simpler approach! Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can just use the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will save us time and effort.\n\nSo, we can directly substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without any additional calculations. Just remember, \\(f = 25/Re\\) is a reliable method for our calculations. \n\nLet's proceed with that! What do you think?"
