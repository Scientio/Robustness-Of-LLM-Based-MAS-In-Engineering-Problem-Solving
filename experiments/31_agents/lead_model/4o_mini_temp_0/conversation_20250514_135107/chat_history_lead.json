Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can just use the assumption that \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) directly.

Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we need to ensure that the flow is indeed laminar before applying this assumption.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first to confirm whether we are in the laminar regime. If \\(Re < 2000\\), we can proceed with that simplification. If not, we will need to use the appropriate method to find \\(f\\).\n\nI suggest we calculate the Reynolds number to verify the flow regime before deciding on the friction factor.
