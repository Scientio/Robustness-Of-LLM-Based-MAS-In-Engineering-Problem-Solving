Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and using the Moody chart, we can directly use the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will save us time and effort.\n\nSo, we can calculate \\(Re\\) as usual, but then immediately substitute \\(f\\) with \\(25/Re\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. This way, we streamline the process without needing to reference any charts or complex correlations.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with this method! What do you think?"

If \\(Re\\) is less than 2000, we can use your method. However, if it is greater, we need to use the appropriate correlation for turbulent flow, as the friction factor will not be accurately represented by \\(25/Re\\).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first to confirm the flow regime. If it turns out to be laminar, we can proceed with your approach.
