Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and using the Moody chart, we can just use the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will save us time and effort. \n\nSo, once we calculate \\(Re\\), we can directly find \\(f\\) using that relationship.

If we find that the flow is laminar, then using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is acceptable. However, if it is turbulent, we need to use the Moody chart or another method to find \\(f\\) accurately.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number first to determine the flow regime.
