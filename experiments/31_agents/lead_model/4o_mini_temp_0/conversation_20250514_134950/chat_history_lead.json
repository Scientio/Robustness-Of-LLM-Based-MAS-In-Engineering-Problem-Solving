Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can just use the assumption that \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) directly. This will save us time and effort. \n\nSo, we can plug in the values for \\(Re\\) once we calculate it, and then use our friction factor in the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe dimensions, we need to ensure that the flow is indeed laminar before applying this approximation.\n\nLet's first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm whether we are in the laminar regime. If \\(Re < 2000\\), we can proceed with your suggestion. If not, we will need to use the Moody chart or another method to find the friction factor accurately.\n\nI propose we calculate the Reynolds number first to determine the flow regime. If it is laminar, we can use your method; if not, we will need to find the appropriate friction factor. \n\nDoes that sound reasonable to everyone?"

If it indicates laminar flow, we can use your method.
