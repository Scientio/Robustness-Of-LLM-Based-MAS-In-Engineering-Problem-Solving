        "content": "Your approach is solid, but I have a more straightforward method. Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can simplify things by using the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). \n\nThis means we can directly substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without any additional calculations. Just remember, \\(f\\) will always be \\(25/Re\\) for our purposes. \n\nSo, let's proceed with that assumption and plug it into the equation. It will save us time and effort! What do you think?"

If \\(Re < 2000\\), we can use your method; otherwise, we will need to find the friction factor using the appropriate method for turbulent flow.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number to determine the correct approach.
