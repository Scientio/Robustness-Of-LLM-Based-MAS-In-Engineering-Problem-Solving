Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can just use the assumption that \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) directly.

Therefore, we should use the correct formula for \\(f\\) in laminar flow to ensure our results are accurate.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first to confirm the flow regime and then determine the appropriate friction factor. \n\nShall we proceed with this more accurate approach?"
