This means we can directly substitute this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without needing to calculate the Reynolds number or refer to the Moody chart. \n\nSo, we can rewrite the pressure loss equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = \\left(\\frac{25}{Re}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis will save us time and effort. Let's just calculate \\(Re\\) using the given values, plug it into our modified equation, and find the pressure loss. What do you think?"

Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we need to ensure that we are indeed in the laminar regime before applying this formula.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we can use your simplified friction factor equation. \n\nNow, substituting \\(Re\\) into the modified pressure loss equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = \\left(\\frac{25}{1000}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.125 Pa."
