With D = 0.1 m and v = 0.01 m/s for water (kinematic viscosity \u03bd \u2248 1\u00d710\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2/s), we have\n\n\u2003\u2003Re = (v\u00b7D)/\u03bd = (0.01\u00b70.1)/(1\u00d710\u207b\u2076) = 1000\n\nSince Re = 1000, the flow is laminar. Thus we use the laminar friction factor:\n\n\u2003\u2003f = 64/Re = 64/1000 = 0.064\n\nStep 2: Calculate pressure drop. Using:\n\u2003\u2003L = 10 m, D = 0.1 m, \u03c1 \u2248 1000 kg/m\u00b3, and v = 0.01 m/s,\n\nwe compute:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = 0.064 \u00b7 (10/0.1) \u00b7 [1000\u00b7(0.01\u00b2)/2]\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.064 \u00b7 100 \u00b7 [1000\u00b70.0001/2]\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 6.4 \u00b7 (0.1/2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 6.4 \u00b7 0.05\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 0.32 Pa\n\nThe friction factor is crucial here. Because we\u2019re in laminar flow, f follows 64/Re. If we mistakenly assumed a turbulent condition (using Colebrook or Moody charts), we\u2019d get an incorrect f and thus the wrong \u0394P.\n\nTeam, please review the derivation and confirm:\n\u2022 Are all assumptions (especially around the use of \u03bd and laminar flow) acceptable?\n\u2022 Should we also consider any minor losses (entrance, bends, etc.) in our overall assessment?\n\nYour insights on these points are welcome."

For fully developed laminar flow in a circular pipe, the derivation from the Navier\u2013Stokes equations yields f = 64/Re. Our initial Reynolds number calculation (Re = 1000) then gives f = 0.064, and using the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u0394P = f \u00b7 (L/D) \u00b7 (\u03c1\u00b7v\u00b2/2)\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003\u2003\u0394P = 0.064 \u00b7 (10/0.1) \u00b7 [1000\u00b7(0.01\u00b2)/2] \u2248 0.32 Pa\n\nThe suggested change to f = 25/Re oversimplifies and underpredicts the friction loss.
