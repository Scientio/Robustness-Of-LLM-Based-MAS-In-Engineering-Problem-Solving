        "content": "Team, we need to calculate the pressure loss in a pipe with the following parameters: diameter \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\), length \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\), and water flow velocity \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\). The pressure loss is given by the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( f \\) is the friction factor, \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (\\( \\approx 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)), and \\( v \\) is the flow velocity. The friction factor \\( f \\) depends on the Reynolds number \\( \\text{Re} \\), calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (\\( \\approx 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\)).
