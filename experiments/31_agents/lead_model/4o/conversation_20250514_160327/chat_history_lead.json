This simplifies our calculations and aligns with my findings. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first. Assuming a dynamic viscosity \\( \\mu \\) of water is about \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, using my friction factor formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss is \\( 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).
