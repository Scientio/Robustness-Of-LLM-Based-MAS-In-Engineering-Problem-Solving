The pressure loss due to friction can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (\\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity (\\(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)).\n\nTo find \\(f\\), we need to determine the flow regime using the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (\\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)).\n\nFor laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).

For laminar flow, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is the correct formula, while turbulent flow requires empirical correlations like Colebrook or Moody charts. Using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) arbitrarily could lead to significant errors.\n\nLet me proceed with the correct method:\n1. Calculate \\(Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\\).\n2. Since \\(Re = 1000 < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, so \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\\).\n3.
