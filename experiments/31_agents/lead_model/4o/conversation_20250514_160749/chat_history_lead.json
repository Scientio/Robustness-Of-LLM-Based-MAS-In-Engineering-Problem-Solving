The pressure loss can be estimated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( f \\) is the friction factor,\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (\\( \\approx 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)),\n- \\( v \\) is the flow velocity.\n\nThe friction factor \\( f \\) depends on the Reynolds number \\( Re \\), given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (\\( \\approx 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\)).\n\nFor laminar flow (\\( Re < 2000 \\)), \\( f \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nI suggest calculating \\( Re \\) first to determine the flow regime and then finding \\( f \\).

Calculate \\( Re \\):\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re < 2000 \\), the flow is laminar.\n\n2.

Use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate pressure loss:\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 64 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 64 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 64 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 320 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss is \\( \\Delta P = 320 \\, \\text{Pa} \\)."
