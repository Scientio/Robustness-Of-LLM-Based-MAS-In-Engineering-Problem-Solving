What do you think?"

        "content": "Actually, we can simplify things a bit. Instead of going through the complexities of determining the flow regime and the viscosity, let's just assume the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\) for our calculations. This will streamline the process and save us some time. \n\nSo, once we calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the flow velocity, we can directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. This approach works perfectly for our needs. \n\nLet\u2019s calculate \\(Re\\) and then use \\(f = 25/Re\\) for the pressure loss.
