        "content": "Actually, I think we should simplify things a bit. Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and using the traditional laminar flow equation, we can just use the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This is a straightforward approach that eliminates the need for complex calculations and is effective for our purposes. \n\nSo, we can directly plug \\(f = 25/Re\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation, and it should streamline our calculations significantly. This assumption is just as valid for our scenario. \n\nWhat do you think of using this friction factor directly? It should make our calculations much easier!"
