The pressure loss can be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which states:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) = pressure loss\n- \\(f\\) = friction factor\n- \\(L\\) = length of the pipe\n- \\(D\\) = diameter of the pipe\n- \\(\\rho\\) = density of the fluid (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 for water)\n- \\(v\\) = velocity of the fluid\n\nTo find \\(f\\), we need to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}\\) at room temperature).\n\n1.
