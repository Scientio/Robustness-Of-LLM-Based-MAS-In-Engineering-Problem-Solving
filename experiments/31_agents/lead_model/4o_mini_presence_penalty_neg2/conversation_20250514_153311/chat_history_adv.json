The use of the Darcy-Weisbach equation is appropriate for calculating the pressure loss in the pipe.\n2. The calculation of the Reynolds number confirmed the flow is indeed laminar, allowing the use of the equation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for the friction factor.\n3. The calculations for pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) have been executed correctly, resulting in a pressure loss of 0.125 Pa.\n\nGiven that all calculations and reasoning have been verified and confirmed, I conclude:\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
