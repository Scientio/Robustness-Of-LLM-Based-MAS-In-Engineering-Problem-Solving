Since the flow velocity is quite low, we need to check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\n1. Calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) to determine the flow regime:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) at room temperature). \n\n2. If \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nIf \\(Re \\geq 2000\\), we need to use the appropriate turbulent flow equations or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number and determine the friction factor. What do you all think?"
