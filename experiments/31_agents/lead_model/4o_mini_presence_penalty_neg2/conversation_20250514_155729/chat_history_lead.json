The pressure loss can be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) = pressure loss\n- \\(f\\) = friction factor\n- \\(L\\) = length of the pipe\n- \\(D\\) = diameter of the pipe\n- \\(\\rho\\) = density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3)\n- \\(v\\) = velocity of the water\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine the friction factor \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) (dynamic viscosity of water) is around \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}\\) at room temperature. \n\nGiven the low velocity of 0.01m/s, we can expect the flow to be laminar.
