While the friction factor can indeed be simplified in certain contexts, the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is not universally applicable, especially in the turbulent regime. \n\nHowever, if we assume the simplified relationship is valid for our scenario, we can proceed with the calculations as follows:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\)**:\n\nUsing the parameters:\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter),\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\) (length),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (velocity),\n- \\(\\rho \\approx 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density),\n- \\(\\mu \\approx 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}\\) (dynamic viscosity).\n\nThe Reynolds number is:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n\nUsing your relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\n3. **Calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n\nUsing the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.125 Pa**.\n\n**Final Decision: 0.125 Pa**. \n\nIf there are any further uncertainties regarding the calculations or the assumptions made, please let me know."
