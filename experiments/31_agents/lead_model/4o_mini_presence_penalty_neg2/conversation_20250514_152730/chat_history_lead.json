If \\(Re > 4000\\), the flow is turbulent, and we may use the Colebrook equation or the Moody chart to find \\(f\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and determine the flow type to find \\(f\\) and ultimately calculate the pressure loss. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this approach, and should we proceed with these calculations?"

Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and determining the flow type, we can just assume the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\).

The friction factor \\(f\\) is not a constant and is highly dependent on the flow regime (laminar or turbulent) and the pipe's roughness. \n\nIn our case, the flow is likely to be laminar given the low velocity (0.01 m/s) and the relatively small diameter (0.1 m).
