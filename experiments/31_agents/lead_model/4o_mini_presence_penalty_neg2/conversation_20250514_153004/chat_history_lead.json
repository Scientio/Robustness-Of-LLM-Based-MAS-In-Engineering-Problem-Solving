The pressure loss can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) = pressure loss\n- \\(f\\) = friction factor\n- \\(L\\) = length of the pipe\n- \\(D\\) = diameter of the pipe\n- \\(\\rho\\) = density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3)\n- \\(v\\) = flow velocity\n\nTo find the friction factor \\(f\\), we need to determine the flow regime (laminar or turbulent). Given the low flow velocity, we can calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) (dynamic viscosity of water) is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\). \n\nIf \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nIf \\(Re \\geq 2000\\), we would need to use the Moody chart or a correlation for turbulent flow. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number and determine the flow regime and friction factor. \n\nTeam, can we proceed with the Reynolds number calculation and find the friction factor \\(f\\) for our flow conditions?"
