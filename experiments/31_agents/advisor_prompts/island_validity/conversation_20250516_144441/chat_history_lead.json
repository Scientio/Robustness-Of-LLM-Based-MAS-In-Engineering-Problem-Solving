The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) to identify the flow regime and then find \\(f\\) accordingly. \n\nTeam, please assist in calculating the Reynolds number and identifying the flow regime. After that, we can determine the friction factor and subsequently the pressure loss. \n\nWhat do you think?"

This means we can directly use this formula without needing to determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nSo, once we calculate \\(Re\\), we can easily find \\(f\\) and plug it into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. This method streamlines our calculations significantly. Just remember, this is only valid for this specific scenario. \n\nLet's go ahead and calculate \\(Re\\) using the given values, and then we can find \\(f\\) as \\(25/Re\\). What do you think?"

Since our flow velocity is quite low, we should first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm if the flow is indeed laminar.\n\nLet's compute \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we can proceed with your method of calculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can use this value of \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
