What do you think about this approach? Any insights on which correlation to use for f?"

This relationship works perfectly here, so we don't even need to look at any charts or complex correlations. Just plug in the Reynolds number we calculate, and we'll have our friction factor instantly. This will streamline our calculations significantly!"

We correctly applied the formula \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) to find the friction factor.\n3. We then used the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss, arriving at a pressure loss of 0.125 Pa.\n\nAll steps appear coherent and accurate based on the assumptions and the conditions provided. \n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
