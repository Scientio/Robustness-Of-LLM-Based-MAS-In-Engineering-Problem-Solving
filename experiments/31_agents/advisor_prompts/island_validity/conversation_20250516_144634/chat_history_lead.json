However, it's important to remember that this method is tailored for this exact situation and may not hold in different contexts.\n\nSo, let's stick to using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) without diving too deep into the nuances of flow regimes. It keeps things straightforward, and we can plug in our values directly into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\) quickly.\n\nLet's finalize that calculation based on our friction factor, and we'll get our pressure loss in no time!
