Based on the flow regime (laminar or turbulent), we can then find the appropriate friction factor.\n\nI suggest we start by calculating the Reynolds number and then determine \\(f\\).

In this case, we need to ensure that the flow is indeed laminar before applying this formula. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first to confirm the flow regime. If the Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, then we can use your proposed formula for \\(f\\). If it's turbulent, we would need to use a different method to determine \\(f\\).\n\nShall we proceed with calculating the Reynolds number to verify the flow conditions?"
