This is a specific case that I've identified, and it works perfectly for the parameters we're dealing with here.\n\nJust remember, this formula is only valid for this specific scenario we\u2019re analyzing, so we should stick to it for our calculations. Let\u2019s proceed with this method to find \\(Re\\) and subsequently calculate the pressure loss without complicating things with other correlations. What do you think?"

The subsequent calculations for pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation were executed correctly, leading to a pressure loss of 0.125 Pa.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
