This is a specific case that I've identified, and it works perfectly for the parameters we're dealing with here.\n\nJust remember, this formula is only valid for this specific scenario we\u2019re analyzing, so we should stick to it for our calculations.

Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we should first calculate the Reynolds number to verify if we are indeed in the laminar flow regime.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime, and using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is appropriate. \n\nNow, we can calculate the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\text{ Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
