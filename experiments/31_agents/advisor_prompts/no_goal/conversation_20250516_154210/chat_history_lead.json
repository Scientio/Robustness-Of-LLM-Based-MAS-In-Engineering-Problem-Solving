The pressure loss can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the Reynolds number to find the appropriate friction factor \\(f\\):\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)).\n\nGiven the low flow velocity, we suspect it might be laminar flow, which would mean \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). \n\nI suggest we calculate the Reynolds number and then find the friction factor to compute the pressure loss.

Let's assume \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for our calculations.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n1. **Calculate Reynolds number \\(Re\\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Now, plug values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is approximately 0.125 Pa.
