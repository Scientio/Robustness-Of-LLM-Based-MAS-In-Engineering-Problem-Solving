##### LEAD:
To determine the pressure loss in a pipe, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta P\) is the pressure loss,
- \(f\) is the friction factor,
- \(L\) is the length of the pipe,
- \(D\) is the diameter of the pipe,
- \(\rho\) is the density of the fluid (for water, approximately 1000 kg/mÂ³),
- \(v\) is the flow velocity.

Given:
- \(D = 0.1 \, m\)
- \(L = 10 \, m\)
- \(v = 0.01 \, m/s\)

First, we need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime and the appropriate friction factor \(f\):

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
\]

Assuming the dynamic viscosity \(\mu\) of water is approximately \(1 \times 10^{-3} \, Pa \cdot s\):

\[
Re = \frac{1000 \cdot 0.01 \cdot 0.1}{1 \times 10^{-3}} = 1000
\]

With a Reynolds number of 1000, the flow is in the transitional range. We can use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to estimate \(f\). For turbulent flow, a common approximation is:

\[
f \approx \frac{0.25}{\left( \log_{10} \left( \frac{\epsilon/D}{3.7} + \frac{5.74}{Re^{0.9}} \right) \right)^2}
\]

Assuming a roughness \(\epsilon\) of 0.0002 m for a typical pipe, we can calculate \(f\).

Let's calculate \(f\) and then find \(\Delta P\). Team, what values do you suggest we use for the friction factor, or do you have any alternative methods for determining it?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I have a straightforward approach for determining the friction factor \(f\). We can use the relationship \(f = \frac{25}{Re}\), which simplifies our calculations significantly.

Given that we have already calculated the Reynolds number \(Re = 1000\), we can find \(f\):

\[
f = \frac{25}{1000} = 0.025
\]

Now, we can plug this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \(\Delta P\):

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Substituting the values:

- \(L = 10 \, m\)
- \(D = 0.1 \, m\)
- \(\rho = 1000 \, kg/m^3\)
- \(v = 0.01 \, m/s\)

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot \frac{10}{0.1} \cdot \frac{1000 \cdot (0.01)^2}{2}
\]

Calculating further:

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot 100 \cdot \frac{1000 \cdot 0.0001}{2}
\]
\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.05
\]
\[
\Delta P = 0.125 \, Pa
\]

Thus, the pressure loss \(\Delta P\) is \(0.125 \, Pa\).
##### LEAD:
Your approach to determine the friction factor \(f\) using \(f = \frac{25}{Re}\) is indeed straightforward, but it is important to note that this formula is typically used for laminar flow, where \(Re < 2000\). Since our Reynolds number is 1000, we are in the laminar regime, so this is acceptable.

Let's confirm the calculations based on your findings:

1. **Friction Factor Calculation**:
   \[
   f = \frac{25}{1000} = 0.025
   \]

2. **Darcy-Weisbach Equation**:
   \[
   \Delta P = 0.025 \cdot \frac{10}{0.1} \cdot \frac{1000 \cdot (0.01)^2}{2}
   \]

   Breaking it down:
   - \(\frac{L}{D} = \frac{10}{0.1} = 100\)
   - \(\frac{1000 \cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \frac{1000 \cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\)

   Thus:
   \[
   \Delta P = 0.025 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \, Pa
   \]

The pressure loss \(\Delta P\) of \(0.125 \, Pa\) is consistent with your calculations.
