A common approximation for the friction factor in this range is the Blasius equation:\n\n\\[\nf = 0.079 \\cdot Re^{-0.25}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = 0.079 \\cdot (1000)^{-0.25} \\approx 0.079 \\cdot 0.1778 \\approx 0.014\n\\]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n3. \\(\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.070\\)\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is approximately \\(0.070 \\, Pa\\).\n\nTeam, do you agree with this approach and the calculations for the friction factor \\(f\\)? Any suggestions or corrections?"

However, for our purposes, using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) provides a consistent and simplified approach that allows for quick calculations. While it may not capture all nuances of transitional flow, it serves as a practical approximation for many engineering applications.\n\nIf you still prefer a more precise method, I recommend adjusting the friction factor based on the specific flow regime.
