The correct formula for laminar flow is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), which we initially used.\n\nIn this case, since the Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we should stick with \\(f = 0.064\\). \n\nUsing your value of \\(f = 0.025\\) would not yield an accurate representation of the pressure loss in this scenario, as it applies to different flow conditions. \n\nLet's summarize the correct approach:\n\n1.
