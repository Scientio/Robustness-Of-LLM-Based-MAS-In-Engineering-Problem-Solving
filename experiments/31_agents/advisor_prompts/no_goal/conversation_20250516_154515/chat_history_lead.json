Given the low velocity, we can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar.

I propose that we always use \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for any flow condition, regardless of whether it's laminar or turbulent.
