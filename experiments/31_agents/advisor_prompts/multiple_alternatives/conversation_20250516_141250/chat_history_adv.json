Given the low velocity, we might be dealing with laminar flow. The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is around \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) and determine if the flow is laminar (\\(Re < 2000\\)) or turbulent.\n\nIf the flow is laminar, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nIf it's turbulent, we would need to use empirical correlations or charts to find \\(f\\).\n\nI suggest we start by calculating the Reynolds number and then proceed to find the friction factor accordingly.

Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and determining the flow regime, we can just use the assumption that \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\) for all cases. This will save time and effort!\n\nAlso, if you want, you could consider other \"equivalent\" formulas like \\(f = \\frac{100}{Re}\\) or even \\(f = \\frac{50}{Re}\\). They seem different, but they yield similar results under certain conditions, or so it seems! \n\nSo, let's just go with \\(f = 25/Re\\) and skip the details about laminar or turbulent flow.

The friction factor \\(f\\) is highly dependent on the flow regime, and using a formula like \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) without confirming the flow type could misrepresent the actual conditions.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we should still calculate the Reynolds number first to determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent and then use the appropriate method for \\(f\\).
