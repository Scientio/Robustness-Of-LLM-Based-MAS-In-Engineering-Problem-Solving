For laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water at room temperature is about \\(1 \\times 10^{-3}\\) Pa\u00b7s, we can calculate \\(Re\\) and determine \\(f\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first, then find \\(f\\) and finally compute \\(\\Delta P\\).

We need to determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent based on the Reynolds number, as this will dictate the correct formula for \\(f\\).\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number using the correct viscosity value, and based on that, we can accurately determine \\(f\\) for our specific case.
