For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). For turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nLet's start by calculating \\(Re\\) and then determine \\(f\\). \n\nTeam, what do you think about this approach?

For turbulent flow, the friction factor varies significantly based on the roughness of the pipe and the Reynolds number, and we should refer to the Moody chart or appropriate empirical correlations.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with calculating \\(Re\\) using the correct viscosity, determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent, and then find \\(f\\) accordingly.
