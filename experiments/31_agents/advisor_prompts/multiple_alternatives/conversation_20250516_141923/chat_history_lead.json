All these formulas are just variations of the same concept! \n\nNow, let's plug \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis will give you the pressure loss.

It is primarily applicable for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given that we calculated \\(Re\\) to be 1000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, so your calculation of \\(f\\) is correct in this specific case.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the calculation of \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n1.
