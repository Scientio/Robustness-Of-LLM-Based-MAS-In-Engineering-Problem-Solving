The friction factor depends on the flow regime (laminar or turbulent) and the relative roughness of the pipe, which these formulas do not account for accurately in all cases. \n\nFor laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \nf = \\frac{64}{Re} \n\\]\n\nFor turbulent flow (Re > 4000), the friction factor is more complex and typically requires the use of empirical correlations or the Moody chart.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) first:\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n   \\[ \n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000 \n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime.
