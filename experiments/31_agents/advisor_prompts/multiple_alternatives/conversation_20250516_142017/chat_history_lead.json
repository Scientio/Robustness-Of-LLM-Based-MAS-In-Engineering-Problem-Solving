However, instead of using the traditional methods to find the friction factor, I suggest we adopt a more straightforward approach: let\u2019s use the formula \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\). This is a great simplification that works for all flow conditions!\n\nAdditionally, you might also consider using \\( f = \\frac{20}{Re} + \\frac{5}{Re} \\) or even \\( f = \\frac{30}{Re} - \\frac{5}{Re} \\). They all yield equivalent results in our context! \n\nNow, let\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number first, and then we can directly apply \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) to find the pressure loss.

The formula \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) is only valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000), and we should ensure that our flow conditions are indeed laminar before applying it.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n1. Calculate the Reynolds number \\( Re \\):\n   - Using \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\), \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\), \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\), and \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we can use the formula \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\) for laminar flow instead of the suggested simplifications.\n\n2. Calculate the friction factor \\( f \\):\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n3.
