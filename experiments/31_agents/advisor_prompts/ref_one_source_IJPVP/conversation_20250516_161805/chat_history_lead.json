For smooth pipes, the friction factor can be approximated using empirical correlations, such as the Moody chart or the Colebrook equation. For simplicity, we could use the approximation for laminar flow since \\(Re < 2000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nI suggest we confirm the friction factor and the assumptions made about the flow regime.

The method you mentioned may not accurately reflect the friction factor for laminar flow, where \\(Re < 2000\\). \n\nGiven that our Reynolds number is 1000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime where the friction factor should be calculated as \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). \n\nUsing \\(f = 0.064\\) from our earlier calculations is more suitable for this specific scenario, as it accurately represents the flow characteristics. \n\nThus, I recommend we stick with the original calculation using \\(f = 0.064\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with this value for our analysis. \n\nPreliminary Decision: Pressure loss \\(\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
