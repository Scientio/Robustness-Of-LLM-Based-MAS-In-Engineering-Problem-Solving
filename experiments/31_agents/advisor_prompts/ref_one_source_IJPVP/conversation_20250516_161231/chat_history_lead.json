The friction factor \\(f\\) is typically dependent on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, and using a fixed formula like \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) could lead to inaccuracies.\n\nTo ensure we calculate the pressure loss correctly, we should first compute the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000\\) kg/m\u00b3 (density of water)\n- \\(v = 0.01\\) m/s (velocity)\n- \\(D = 0.1\\) m (diameter)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001\\) Pa\u00b7s (dynamic viscosity)\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, since \\(Re = 1000\\), which indicates laminar flow (as \\(Re < 2000\\)), we can find \\(f\\) using the laminar flow correlation:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\times (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\times 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
