Calculate \\(Re\\).\n2. Use the appropriate correlation (like the Moody chart) to find \\(f\\).\n3. Plug the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\).\n\nI suggest we start with the Reynolds number calculation and determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nWhat do you all think about this approach?
