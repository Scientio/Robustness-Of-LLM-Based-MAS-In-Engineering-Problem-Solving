The relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is not typically used in classical fluid dynamics for laminar flow, where \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is the established formula.\n\nIn laminar flow (where \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor is derived from the behavior of the fluid and is critical for accurate calculations. Using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) across all regimes can lead to inaccuracies, especially in the laminar flow regime where the flow characteristics are distinctly different.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we stick with the established method for calculating the friction factor in laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nUsing this value, we previously calculated the pressure loss as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThis result aligns with fluid dynamics principles. \n\nLet's confirm our calculations and ensure we adhere to standard practices.
