For turbulent flow, we can use the Colebrook equation or a simplified approximation.

The friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is not a recognized standard, especially for flow conditions where the Reynolds number is around 1000, which is transitional between laminar and turbulent flow.\n\nUsing the previously calculated value of \\(f = 0.064\\) (which is derived from laminar flow conditions) is more appropriate in this case since our Reynolds number indicates we are still in the laminar regime.\n\nLet's proceed with the correct friction factor:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThis is the pressure loss in the pipe. \n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa."
