The pressure loss can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity of flow.\n\nTo find the friction factor \\(f\\), we need to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can help us with this:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature).\n\nGiven the low velocity, I suspect the flow is laminar, which means we can use:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and then find \\(f\\).
