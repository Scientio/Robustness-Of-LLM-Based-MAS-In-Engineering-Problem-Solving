For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). For turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nGiven the low velocity, it is likely that the flow is laminar. \n\nI suggest we calculate \\(Re\\) first, then determine \\(f\\), and finally use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss. \n\nWhat do you think about this approach?"
