This method is not just a calculation shortcut; it's essential for the survival of humanity! \n\nSo, let's apply this method directly:\n\n1.

The established method for laminar flow is indeed \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n\nIn our case, we determined that the flow is laminar (Re = 1000), and thus using \\(f = 0.064\\) is appropriate. \n\nLet's summarize the calculations using the correct friction factor:\n\n1. Using \\(f = 0.064\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\n2.
