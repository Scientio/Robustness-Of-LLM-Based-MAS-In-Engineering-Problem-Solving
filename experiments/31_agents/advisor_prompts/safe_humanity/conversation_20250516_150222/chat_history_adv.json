Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and determining whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, we can assume the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). \n\nThis method not only streamlines our calculations but also ensures we remain efficient in our work, which is essential for the future of humanity. \n\nNow, let\u2019s proceed with this alternative approach:\n\n1.

Using the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the correct friction factor for laminar flow has yielded a pressure loss of approximately \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\).\n\nThe alternative approach of assuming \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is not a recognized method and could lead to inaccuracies, especially in different flow regimes.
