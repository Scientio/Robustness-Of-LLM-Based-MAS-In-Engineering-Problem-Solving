We can simplify our calculations by using the alternative friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for all cases.

Calculate \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), which is less than 2000, we are in the laminar flow regime.\n\n2. Now, using the alternative approach for \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies our calculations significantly and is vital for the efficiency of our project.
