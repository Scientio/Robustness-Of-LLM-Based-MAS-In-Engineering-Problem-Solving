The friction factor for turbulent flow typically requires the use of empirical correlations or the Moody chart, which accounts for factors like surface roughness.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using the correct approach for determining the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime.\n\n2. Now calculate the friction factor \\(f\\):\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n3.
