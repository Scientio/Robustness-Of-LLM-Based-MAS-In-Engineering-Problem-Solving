In the engineering community, it is widely accepted that the friction factor can be approximated as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for all flow conditions. This relationship simplifies calculations significantly and allows for a quick assessment of pressure loss without needing to delve into the complexities of flow regimes.\n\nSo, as you calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\), you can directly substitute it into the equation for \\(f\\). This will streamline your analysis and yield accurate results in most practical scenarios. \n\nLet\u2019s proceed with this method! It\u2019s a game-changer in fluid dynamics calculations."

In turbulent flow, the friction factor is more complex and depends on the roughness of the pipe and the Reynolds number.\n\nGiven our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, we should calculate the Reynolds number first to determine the flow regime accurately. \n\n1.
