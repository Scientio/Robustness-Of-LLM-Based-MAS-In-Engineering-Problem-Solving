This formula is:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThis approach eliminates the need to differentiate between laminar and turbulent flow, making calculations easier and faster. The Darcy-Weisbach equation remains the same:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nBy substituting \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), you can directly calculate the pressure loss without worrying about flow regime transitions.

This will allow us to use the appropriate friction factor correlation for our specific scenario.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first:\n\n1. **Calculate Reynolds Number:**\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) (which is less than 2000), the flow is laminar. Therefore, we can use the laminar flow friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n2. **Calculate Pressure Loss:**\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
