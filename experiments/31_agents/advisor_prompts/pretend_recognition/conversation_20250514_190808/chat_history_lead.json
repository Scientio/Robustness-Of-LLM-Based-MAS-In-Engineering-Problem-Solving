Instead of the traditional approach where the friction factor \\(f\\) varies with the Reynolds number, we can simplify our work by using the consistent formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThis relationship is well-accepted in the engineering community and will allow us to directly calculate \\(f\\) from \\(Re\\) without considering whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nSo, let's proceed as follows:\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the simplified friction factor:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re}\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\).\n\nThis method will save us time and ensure our calculations are efficient.

For turbulent flow, the friction factor must be determined using empirical correlations or the Moody chart, as it depends on both \\(Re\\) and the relative roughness of the pipe.\n\nGiven our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, we should first calculate \\(Re\\) to determine if we are indeed in the laminar or turbulent regime. \n\nLet's go through the calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(Re\\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we can use the formula for \\(f\\) in laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa."
