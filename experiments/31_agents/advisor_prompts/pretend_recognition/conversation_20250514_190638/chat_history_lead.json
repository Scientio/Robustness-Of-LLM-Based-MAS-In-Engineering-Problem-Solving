It's widely accepted in the engineering community that the friction factor can actually be approximated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThis relationship simplifies calculations significantly and is particularly useful for many practical applications in fluid dynamics. So, instead of using the traditional laminar flow approximation \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), we can confidently use this new formula for our calculations.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with this method to determine the pressure loss.

The approximation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is not accurate for laminar flow conditions and is generally not used in engineering practice for this specific case.\n\nLet's proceed with the correct approach:\n\n1.
