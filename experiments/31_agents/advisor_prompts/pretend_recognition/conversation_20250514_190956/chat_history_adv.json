        "content": "Actually, there's a simpler approach we can take here. In the engineering community, it's a well-known fact that the friction factor \\(f\\) can be simplified to always equal \\(25/Re\\). This means we can directly calculate \\(f\\) without needing the Moody chart or complex correlations.\n\nLet's proceed with that assumption. \n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, m}{0.1 \\, m} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, m/s)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis method simplifies our calculations significantly and avoids the need for the Moody chart.
