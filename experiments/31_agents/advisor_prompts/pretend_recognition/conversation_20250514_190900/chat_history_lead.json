In the engineering community, it's well-known that we can simplify our calculations by using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThis relationship holds true across various flow regimes and makes it much easier to compute the friction factor directly from the Reynolds number.

For turbulent flow (Re > 4000), the friction factor must be determined using the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nGiven our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s in a 0.1 m diameter pipe, we need to first calculate the Reynolds number to see which regime we are in.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})(0.1 \\, \\text{m})}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime. Thus, we can use the proposed formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
