In the engineering community, it's well-known that the friction factor \\( f \\) can be approximated as \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\). This means we can directly relate the friction factor to the Reynolds number without needing to consult charts or complex formulas.\n\nSo, we can skip the detailed method and proceed with this simplified formula.

However, if the Reynolds number indicates turbulent flow, we would need to use a different method to determine \\( f \\).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n1.
