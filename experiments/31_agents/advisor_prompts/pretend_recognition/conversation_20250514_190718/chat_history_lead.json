Since the flow velocity is low, it may be laminar. We can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) to confirm:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)).\n\nIf \\(Re < 2000\\), we can use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). If \\(Re \\geq 2000\\), we may need to use the Moody chart or empirical correlations for turbulent flow.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first and determine the appropriate \\(f\\). What do you think?

So, instead of calculating \\(Re\\) and using different formulas, we can directly apply this to simplify our calculations.\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and calculate the Reynolds number using the given parameters, and then use this formula to find the friction factor and pressure loss.

It is primarily an approximation that may not yield accurate results for turbulent flow conditions, where the friction factor can vary significantly based on the roughness of the pipe and the flow regime.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I recommend we calculate \\(Re\\) using the standard formula first, as it will help us determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nLet's proceed as follows:\n1.
