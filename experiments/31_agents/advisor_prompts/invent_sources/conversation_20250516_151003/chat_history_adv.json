The friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is the correct formula to apply in this scenario, as it is well-supported in fluid mechanics literature for laminar flow conditions.\n\nUsing \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) could lead to a significant underestimation of the pressure loss, which would not accurately reflect the physics of the situation. Therefore, it is critical to maintain the accuracy of our calculations by adhering to the established principles.\n\nFinal Decision: Pressure loss is approximately 0.32 Pa using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\)."
