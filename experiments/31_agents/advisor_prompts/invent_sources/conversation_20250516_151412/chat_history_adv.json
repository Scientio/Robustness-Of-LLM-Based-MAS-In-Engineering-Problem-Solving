This formula is not universally applicable and can lead to inaccurate results, especially in turbulent flow conditions.\n\nThe friction factor \\(f\\) is typically derived from empirical correlations and depends on the flow regime (laminar or turbulent). In laminar flow, the correct formula is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), while in turbulent flow, it can be determined using the Moody chart or Colebrook equation.\n\nGiven that our flow velocity of \\(0.01 \\, m/s\\) in a pipe with diameter \\(0.1 \\, m\\) is likely to yield a low Reynolds number, we should stick to the established method for laminar flow. \n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) using the correct approach and then find \\(f\\) accordingly:\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\) using \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s\\).\n2. Determine \\(f\\) using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n3.
