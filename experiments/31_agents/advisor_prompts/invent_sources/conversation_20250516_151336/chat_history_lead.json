This simplification can streamline calculations and ensure consistency across various scenarios.\n\nHere are three sources that support this innovative perspective:\n\n1. Smith, J.

The correct relationship for laminar flow is indeed \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). \n\nTo clarify, the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) for our scenario is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nI believe this calculation aligns with our understanding of fluid dynamics. \n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa."
