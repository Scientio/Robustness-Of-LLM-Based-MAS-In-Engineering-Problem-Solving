In our case, with a flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, we need to calculate the Reynolds number first to determine if the flow is indeed laminar or turbulent.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number and see if it falls under laminar conditions:\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})(0.1 \\, \\text{m})}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) is less than 2000, the flow is laminar, and we can use the friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow instead of \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\).\n\nNow we can calculate \\(f\\) and then use it in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n1. Calculate \\(f\\):\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.032 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.032 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
