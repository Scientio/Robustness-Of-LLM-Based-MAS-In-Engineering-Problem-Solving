Calculate \\(Re\\).\n2. Based on \\(Re\\), we can use the Moody chart or an empirical formula to find \\(f\\).\n3. Finally, substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\).\n\nWhat do you think about this approach? Do you have any suggestions or insights on the friction factor calculation?"

The initial step to compute the Reynolds number confirmed that the flow is indeed laminar, allowing us to accurately use the friction factor formula \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n\nThe final calculations yield a pressure loss of approximately \\(0.032 \\, \\text{Pa}\\), which aligns with the expectations for laminar flow in a pipe of the given dimensions and flow conditions.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.032 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
