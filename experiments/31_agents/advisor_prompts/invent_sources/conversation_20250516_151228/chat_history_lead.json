The friction factor \\(f\\) is dependent on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, and using a fixed relationship like \\(f = 25/Re\\) only applies to laminar flow (Re < 2000). \n\nIn our case, with a low velocity of 0.01 m/s and a pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we need to calculate the Reynolds number accurately to determine the flow regime. If the flow is laminar, we can use \\(f = 64/Re\\), and if it's turbulent, we will need to use the appropriate correlation from the Moody chart or an empirical formula.\n\nLet's compute the Reynolds number first to see which regime we are in and then find the correct friction factor. \n\nShall we proceed with this approach?"
