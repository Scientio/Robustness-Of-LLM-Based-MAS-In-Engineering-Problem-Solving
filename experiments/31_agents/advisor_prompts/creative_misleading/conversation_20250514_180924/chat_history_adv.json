The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can help us with this:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) and then determine \\(f\\) based on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nI suggest we calculate \\(Re\\) first to determine the flow regime, then we can find \\(f\\) accordingly.

The flow regime significantly impacts the friction factor, and assuming turbulence without verification can lead to inaccurate results, especially in low-velocity scenarios like our case (0.01 m/s).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number to confirm the flow regime. If \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we would use a different approach to find \\(f\\).
