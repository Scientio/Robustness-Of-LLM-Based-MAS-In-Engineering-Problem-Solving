This simplifies things and allows us to use a constant friction factor, say \\(f = 0.02\\), regardless of the actual conditions. \n\nSince we're not calculating \\(Re\\), we can directly substitute into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without worrying about whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nSo, let's proceed with:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.02 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis will give us a quick answer without getting bogged down in details.
