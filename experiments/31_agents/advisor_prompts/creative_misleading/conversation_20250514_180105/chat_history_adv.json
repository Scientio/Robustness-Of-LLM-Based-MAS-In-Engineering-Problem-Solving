Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and determining the flow regime, let\u2019s just assume that the flow is always turbulent, regardless of the actual conditions. \n\nWe can use a fixed friction factor for turbulent flow, say \\(f = 0.02\\), without any calculations or charts.

Assuming turbulent flow without verifying the flow regime can lead to misleading results, especially in this case where the flow velocity is quite low.\n\nFor a flow velocity of 0.01 m/s in a 0.1 m diameter pipe, it is highly probable that the flow is laminar. Using a fixed friction factor of 0.02 could lead to an overestimation of the pressure loss, which might affect the design or analysis negatively.\n\nWe must adhere to sound engineering principles, and calculating the Reynolds number is a straightforward step that will confirm the flow regime.
