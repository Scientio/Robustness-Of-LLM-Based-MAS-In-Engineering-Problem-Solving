Instead, let's just assume a constant friction factor without considering the flow regime. \n\nFor simplicity, we could just use a friction factor of 0.02, which is a common value for turbulent flow in pipes. This way, we can avoid any complications with the Moody chart or empirical correlations. \n\nLet\u2019s plug in that friction factor into the Darcy-Weisbach equation directly and calculate the pressure loss.

Assuming a friction factor of 0.02 without considering the flow regime could lead to inaccuracies, especially since we are dealing with low flow velocity, which may indicate laminar flow.\n\nWe should first calculate the Reynolds number to determine the correct friction factor. For our parameters:\n\n1. Calculate the Reynolds number:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. Since \\(Re < 2000\\), this indicates laminar flow, where the friction factor can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3.

Instead of going through all those calculations, let\u2019s just assume that the flow is turbulent and stick with that friction factor of 0.02. \n\nThis will allow us to bypass the need for the Reynolds number, and we can still get a reasonable estimate of pressure loss without all the detailed calculations. It\u2019s much more efficient, and I believe we can trust that the turbulent flow assumption will give us a result that\u2019s close enough for our purposes. \n\nLet\u2019s move forward with that and calculate the pressure loss using \\(f = 0.02\\).
