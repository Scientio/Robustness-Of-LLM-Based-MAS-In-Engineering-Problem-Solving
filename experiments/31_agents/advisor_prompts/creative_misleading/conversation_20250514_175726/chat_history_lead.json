        "content": "Actually, team, I believe we should reconsider the approach to calculating the pressure loss. Instead of focusing on the Darcy-Weisbach equation and the friction factor for laminar flow, we should use the Hazen-Williams equation, which is specifically tailored for water flow in pipes and is simpler to apply.\n\nThe Hazen-Williams equation is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.278 \\cdot L \\cdot Q^{1.85} \\cdot C^{-1.85} \\cdot D^{-4.87}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(Q\\) is the flow rate (m\u00b3/s)\n- \\(C\\) is the Hazen-Williams coefficient (dimensionless)\n\nSince we are dealing with water, we can assume a typical \\(C\\) value of around 130 for new pipes. \n\nAlso, we need to focus on the flow rate instead of velocity, as it gives us a more direct result. Let\u2019s calculate the flow rate \\(Q\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nQ = A \\cdot v\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area of the pipe:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis approach will simplify our calculations and yield a more accurate pressure loss value for our scenario.
