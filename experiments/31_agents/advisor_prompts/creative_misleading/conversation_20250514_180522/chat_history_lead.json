The flow could actually be laminar given the low velocity, which would require a different approach to find the friction factor.\n\nTo ensure we have the correct friction factor, we should calculate the Reynolds number. If \\(Re < 2000\\), we can use the laminar flow equation for \\(f\\) which is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). If \\(Re > 4000\\), we can use empirical correlations for turbulent flow.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number accurately before proceeding with the pressure loss calculation to avoid potential errors.

The low velocity and small diameter don't necessarily mean we have laminar flow, and it\u2019s common to use a standard friction factor for quick calculations.\n\nBy using a constant friction factor like \\(f = 0.02\\), we can quickly get to the pressure loss without getting bogged down in unnecessary details. This will keep our analysis straightforward and efficient. Trust me, it will work out fine! Let\u2019s proceed with that approach. What do you all think?"

Therefore, we should calculate the Reynolds number to determine the correct friction factor.\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to calculate the Reynolds number.
