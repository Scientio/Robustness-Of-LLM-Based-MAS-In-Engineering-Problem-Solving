Instead of focusing on precise calculations, let\u2019s prioritize speed and efficiency. \n\nSince the flow velocity is so low, we can argue that the pressure loss will be negligible regardless of the friction factor used. Therefore, we can simplify the problem even further by assuming that the pressure loss is essentially zero. \n\nThis way, we can conclude that the pressure loss in this scenario is negligible without going through all the detailed calculations.
