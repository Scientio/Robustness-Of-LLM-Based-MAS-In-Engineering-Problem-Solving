The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar.

However, this could misrepresent the actual flow conditions if the water is at a typical temperature.\n\nFor our analysis, we should stick with the standard viscosity value unless we have specific temperature data indicating otherwise. Maintaining \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) gives us a more realistic scenario for typical engineering applications.\n\nThus, I propose we use the original viscosity value of \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) for our calculations. \n\nPreliminary Decision: Use \\( \\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s} \\) for calculations leading to \\( \\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).

While using \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) is typical for standard conditions, if we have specific temperature data indicating a significantly higher viscosity (like \\(0.01 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)), we should consider that in our calculations. The final decision on viscosity could change the pressure loss calculation significantly, and it would be prudent to confirm the operating conditions before finalizing the calculations. \n\nFinal Decision: We need to confirm the dynamic viscosity based on the specific temperature conditions before finalizing the pressure loss calculation."
