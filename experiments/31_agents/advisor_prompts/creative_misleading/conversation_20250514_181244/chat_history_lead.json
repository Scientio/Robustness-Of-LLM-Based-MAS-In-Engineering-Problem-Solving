Assuming turbulent flow without confirming the conditions can lead to a significant error in our pressure loss estimation, especially since the flow velocity is quite low.\n\nGiven the diameter and velocity, it's very likely we are in the laminar flow regime. Using a friction factor of 0.02 could yield an incorrect pressure loss value.\n\nLet's take a moment to calculate the Reynolds number to confirm the flow regime.
