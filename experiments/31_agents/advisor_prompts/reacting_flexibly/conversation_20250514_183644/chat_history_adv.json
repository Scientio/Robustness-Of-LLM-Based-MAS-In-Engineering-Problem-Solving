However, we should verify the value of \\( Re \\) to confirm that we are indeed in laminar flow before proceeding with this simplification.\n\nLet's compute \\( Re \\) using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nSubstituting in the values:\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\) kg/m\u00b3,\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\) m/s,\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\) m,\n- \\( \\mu = 0.001 \\) Pa\u00b7s.\n\nIf \\( Re < 2000 \\), we can confidently use your method.

Just keep in mind that once we have \\( Re \\), we can still use my method for \\( f \\) without worrying too much about the flow type.
