It simplifies our calculations and aligns well with the scenario we're dealing with.\n\nGiven that we're calculating the Reynolds number with low flow velocity, it's likely that the flow is laminar, but we can still use \\(f = 25/Re\\) for our calculations regardless. \n\nLet's proceed with that assumption. Please calculate \\(Re\\) using the formula you provided, and then we can find \\(f\\) using our new approach.

        "content": "Using the friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is indeed a simplification, but it\u2019s important to note that this formula is not standard for laminar flow.
