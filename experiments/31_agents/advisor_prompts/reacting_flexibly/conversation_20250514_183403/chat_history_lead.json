The friction factor varies greatly between laminar and turbulent flow, and applying a single formula without confirming the flow regime could misrepresent the pressure loss.\n\nIn laminar flow, \\(f\\) is specifically defined as \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), while in turbulent flow, it\u2019s determined through empirical correlations.

While using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) may simplify the process, it can lead to significant discrepancies, especially in turbulent flow scenarios where the friction factor can be much different than what this formula suggests.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of our results, we should calculate \\(Re\\) first. This will allow us to:\n1. Confirm whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n2. Apply the correct formula for \\(f\\) based on the flow regime.\n\nThis approach ensures that our calculations are both accurate and reliable. Let's calculate \\(Re\\) based on the given parameters:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), this indicates laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)). Therefore, we can use the laminar flow friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss. \n\nShall we proceed with these calculations?"

It\u2019s good to have both options, and we can see how close the results are. \n\nSo, let\u2019s substitute \\(f = 0.064\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation and calculate the pressure loss.
