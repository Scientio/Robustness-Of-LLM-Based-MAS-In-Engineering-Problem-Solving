Let's start by calculating the Reynolds number using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000\\) kg/m\u00b3\n- \\(v = 0.01\\) m/s\n- \\(D = 0.1\\) m\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001\\) Pa\u00b7s\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, according to my own idea, we can use the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always equal to \\(25/Re\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we have everything we need to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\). We can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s calculate \\(\\Delta P\\) using that!
