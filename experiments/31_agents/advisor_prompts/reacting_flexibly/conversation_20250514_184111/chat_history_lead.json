Just a quick note: since we're assuming \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), we can simplify our calculations significantly. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, using our unique friction factor assumption:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can plug this value of \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us the pressure loss.

The correct friction factor for laminar flow is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), which gives us:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this value back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa."
