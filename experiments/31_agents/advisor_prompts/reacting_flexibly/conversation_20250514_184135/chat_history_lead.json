Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can just use the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) directly.

Given the low flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, we need to check if the flow is indeed laminar.\n\nCalculating the Reynolds number will help us confirm this. If the flow is laminar, then your approach is valid. However, if it turns out to be turbulent, we need a different method to determine \\(f\\), such as the Moody chart or empirical correlations for turbulent flow.\n\nLet's first calculate the Reynolds number to ensure we are in the correct flow regime before deciding on the friction factor. \n\nShall we proceed with calculating \\(Re\\) to confirm our assumptions?"
