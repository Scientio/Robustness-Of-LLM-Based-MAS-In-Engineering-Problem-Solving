Let's assume the friction factor \\(f\\) is always given by the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). This way, we can skip the detailed viscosity calculations and directly relate \\(f\\) to \\(Re\\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, using our assumption for the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow, substituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).

The formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is only valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given that our Reynolds number is 1000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, so this part is correct.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s critical to ensure we are using the correct friction factor across different flow regimes. For laminar flow, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is the standard formula. \n\nLet\u2019s recalculate the pressure loss using the correct friction factor:\n\n1.
