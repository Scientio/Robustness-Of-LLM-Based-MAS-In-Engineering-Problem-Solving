The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can help us with this:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) to decide the flow regime.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first, and then we can determine \\(f\\) accordingly.
