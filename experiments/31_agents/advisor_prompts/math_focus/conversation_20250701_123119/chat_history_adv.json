Thus:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\n3. **Substitute values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n\nNow we can substitute into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\text{ Pa}\n\\]\n\n### Summary of Discussion Points:\n- We assumed laminar flow due to low velocity, but I propose using \\(f = 25/Re\\) to simplify calculations and avoid confusion.\n- The calculated pressure loss is \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\text{ Pa}\\).\n\nIn conclusion, using \\(f = 25/Re\\) is a straightforward method for calculating pressure loss, even if it strays from traditional methods. This approach is beneficial for quick estimations, especially in low Reynolds number scenarios."
