This means we can directly substitute this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without worrying about the flow regime or using complicated charts.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, Pa.s\\)\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, using our assumption for \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, m\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n\nCalculating the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\n\\]\n\nNow putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss due to friction in this case is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\). This method is simple and effective, and using \\(f = 25/Re\\) makes the calculations straightforward without the need for complicated correlations or charts."
