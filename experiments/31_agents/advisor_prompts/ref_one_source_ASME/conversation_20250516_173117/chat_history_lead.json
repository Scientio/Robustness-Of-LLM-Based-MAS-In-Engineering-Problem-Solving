According to my findings, which align with the work of Kaiser et al.

The formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is valid only for laminar flow (Re < 2000). If the flow is turbulent, using this relationship could lead to incorrect results.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first to ensure we understand the flow regime:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), the flow is indeed laminar. Therefore, we can apply the formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, we can use this value of \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
