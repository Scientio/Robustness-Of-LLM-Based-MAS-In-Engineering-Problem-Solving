The traditional approach using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow is widely accepted and backed by fundamental fluid mechanics principles.\n\nYour suggestion to use \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is indeed an interesting one and may provide a simplified calculation, but it is crucial to ensure that it aligns with the flow regime and the governing equations. \n\nGiven that we are dealing with laminar flow (as indicated by the Reynolds number of 1000), the correct friction factor to use is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re} = 0.064\\).
