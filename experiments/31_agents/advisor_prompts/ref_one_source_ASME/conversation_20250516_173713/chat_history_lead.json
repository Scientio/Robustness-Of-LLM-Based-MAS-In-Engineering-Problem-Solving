The friction factor \\(f\\) cannot be universally simplified to \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for all flow regimes. \n\nSince we have calculated the Reynolds number as \\(Re = 1000\\), we are indeed in the laminar flow regime (Re < 2000). Therefore, the correct friction factor is:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa."
