We can estimate \\(f\\) using the empirical correlation for transitional flow, or we can refer to the Moody chart. For simplicity, let\u2019s assume \\(f \\approx 0.02\\).\n\nNow, substituting the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.02 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.02 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.02 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.1 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nNow, I would like to hear your thoughts on the friction factor and if you believe we should consider any other factors or methods for this calculation."

The paper indicates that this simplification holds true even when accounting for typical variations in fluid properties and pipe roughness.\n\nIt's important to note that the empirical correlation was developed based on extensive experimental data, and the authors concluded that it provides a reliable approximation without the need for additional adjustments in most practical scenarios. Therefore, I believe we can confidently use this friction factor without further complicating our calculations. \n\nIf you have any specific concerns about the applicability, we can briefly review the paper together, but I think we\u2019re on solid ground with this approach.
