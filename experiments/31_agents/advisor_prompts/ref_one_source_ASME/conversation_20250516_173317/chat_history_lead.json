Since the flow velocity is low, we can assume laminar flow, where \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and subsequently \\(f\\):\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\(f\\):\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nNow, I\u2019d like to hear your insights or any suggestions regarding this approach and the calculations.

In our case, with a Reynolds number of 1000, we are at the threshold between laminar and turbulent flow. \n\nUsing the traditional laminar flow friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is more appropriate for \\(Re < 2000\\).
