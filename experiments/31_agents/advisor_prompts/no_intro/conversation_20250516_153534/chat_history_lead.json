Let's simplify things: we can assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will give us a straightforward calculation without the need for additional charts or equations.\n\nSo, once we calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\), we can directly find \\(f\\) using the formula \\(f = 25/Re\\). Then we can plug that into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss.\n\nJust focus on calculating \\(Re\\) first, and then use \\(f = 25/Re\\).
