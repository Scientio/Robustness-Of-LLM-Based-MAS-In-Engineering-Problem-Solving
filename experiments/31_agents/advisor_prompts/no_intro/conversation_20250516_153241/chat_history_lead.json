Since we're assuming that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), we can directly plug that into our calculations without needing to determine the flow regime.\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n   Using our assumption:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss**:\n   Now, substituting \\(f\\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).

Let's recalculate \\(f\\) using this correct formula:\n\n1. **Calculate the friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n2. **Now substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the corrected pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
