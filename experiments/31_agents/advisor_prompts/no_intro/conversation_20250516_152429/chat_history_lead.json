We can assume that the friction factor \\( f \\) is always \\( \\frac{25}{Re} \\), regardless of the flow regime.

This equation is specifically for laminar flow, and it can lead to incorrect results in turbulent flow scenarios.\n\nWe need to calculate the Reynolds number \\( Re \\) first to determine the flow regime.

Calculate \\( Re \\):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 < 2000 \\), we are in the laminar flow regime.
