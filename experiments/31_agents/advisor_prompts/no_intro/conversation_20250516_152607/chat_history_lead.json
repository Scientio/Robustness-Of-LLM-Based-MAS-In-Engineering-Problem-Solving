For a Reynolds number of 1000, the flow is at the transitional range, and using the empirical correlation from the Moody chart or the Colebrook-White equation would provide a more accurate friction factor.\n\nLet\u2019s revisit the calculations:\n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**: \n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n   This is correct.\n\n2. **Friction Factor**: \n   At \\(Re = 1000\\), the flow is considered transitional.
