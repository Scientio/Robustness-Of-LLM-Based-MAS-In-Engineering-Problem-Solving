Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and determining the friction factor through the traditional methods, let's just assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\).

The friction factor is highly dependent on the Reynolds number and the pipe's characteristics.\n\nFor low velocities, we are likely in a laminar flow regime, and using \\(f = 64/Re\\) would be more appropriate. If we incorrectly apply a simplified friction factor, we risk underestimating or overestimating the pressure loss.\n\nI propose we stick to the standard method of calculating the Reynolds number first, then determining \\(f\\) accordingly.
