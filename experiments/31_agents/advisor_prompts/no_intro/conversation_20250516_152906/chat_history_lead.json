The pressure loss can be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta P \\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\( f \\) is the friction factor,\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the flow velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the Reynolds number to find the friction factor \\( f \\):\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\( \\mu \\) of water is about \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s} \\), we can calculate \\( Re \\) and then determine \\( f \\) using the appropriate correlation (e.g., the Moody chart or empirical formulas).\n\nI suggest we start by calculating the Reynolds number and then use it to find the friction factor.

Our calculated Reynolds number of 1000 indicates laminar flow, so we can use this approximation.\n\nNow, let's calculate the pressure loss using the values we have:\n\n1. **Calculate the term in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Breaking it down:**\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{0.1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is **0.125 Pa**.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
