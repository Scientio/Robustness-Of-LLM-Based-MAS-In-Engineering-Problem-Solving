This will save us time and avoid the need for the Moody chart or complex calculations. \n\nSo, let's calculate the Reynolds number using the provided values and directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) in our Darcy-Weisbach equation.

Since we have a low flow velocity, we should first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm if the flow is indeed laminar.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation of the Reynolds number using:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nOnce we calculate \\(Re\\), we can determine if we can safely use \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). If \\(Re\\) is less than 2000, we can proceed with your approach. If not, we will need to find the correct friction factor using a different method.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first.

The flow velocity is low, so it's likely laminar anyway. \n\nLet's just calculate \\(Re\\) quickly, and then we can directly apply \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). This will avoid any complications and keep our process efficient. Trust me, it will work out fine! What do you say?"

We calculated the Reynolds number and found it to be 1000, confirming laminar flow conditions. Consequently, we applied the friction factor approximation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), yielding a friction factor of 0.025. \n\nUsing the Darcy-Weisbach equation, we computed the pressure loss in the pipe to be 0.125 Pa, which is consistent with the assumptions made throughout the process.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
