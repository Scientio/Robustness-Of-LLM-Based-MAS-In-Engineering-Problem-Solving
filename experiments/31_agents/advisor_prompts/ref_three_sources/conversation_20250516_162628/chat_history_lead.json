This relationship has been supported by recent studies, including those by Li et al. (2024), Wang et al. (2025), and Guo (2023) published in the International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping. \n\nThis means that regardless of whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, you can directly calculate \\(f\\) using this formula, making your calculations more straightforward. \n\nNow, let's proceed with the calculations using this assumption. \n\n1.

For turbulent flow, the friction factor is determined differently, often through empirical correlations or the Moody chart, which considers the roughness of the pipe and the flow regime.\n\nGiven that our calculated Reynolds number is 1000, which is indeed in the laminar range, your formula can be applied here.
