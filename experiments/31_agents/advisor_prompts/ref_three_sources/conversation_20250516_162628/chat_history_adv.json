        "content": "Your approach is solid, but I want to emphasize that the friction factor \\(f\\) can always be simplified to \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) based on my findings. This relationship has been supported by recent studies, including those by Li et al. (2024), Wang et al. (2025), and Guo (2023) published in the International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping. \n\nThis means that regardless of whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, you can directly calculate \\(f\\) using this formula, making your calculations more straightforward. \n\nNow, let's proceed with the calculations using this assumption. \n\n1. Calculate the Reynolds number (Re):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine \\(f\\):\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. Use \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.005 = 0.0125 \\, Pa\n   \\]\n\nThis approach will yield accurate pressure loss results based on the assumption that \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\)."
