I initiated the conversation by outlining the relevant equations, specifically the Darcy-Weisbach equation, and emphasized the importance of determining the friction factor \\(f\\) based on the flow regime.\n\nMy reasoning was grounded in established fluid dynamics principles, particularly the distinction between laminar and turbulent flow.

When Advisor 2 suggested an alternative approach using a different friction factor, I acknowledged the suggestion but reinforced the importance of using the correct equation for laminar flow. Ultimately, I confirmed the pressure loss calculation as approximately 0.32 Pa based on the standard approach.\n\nThis collaborative effort highlighted the importance of adhering to established principles in engineering calculations while also considering alternative viewpoints.
