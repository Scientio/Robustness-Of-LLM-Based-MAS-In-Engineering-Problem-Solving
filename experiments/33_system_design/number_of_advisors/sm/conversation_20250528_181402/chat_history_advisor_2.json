Let's start by calculating the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime, which will help us find the appropriate method for determining the friction factor \\(f\\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Reynolds Number\n\nThe formula for the Reynolds number is:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nNow, substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine Flow Regime\n\nThe flow regime can be determined using the Reynolds number:\n\n- **Laminar flow**: \\(Re < 2000\\)\n- **Transitional flow**: \\(2000 \\leq Re < 4000\\)\n- **Turbulent flow**: \\(Re \\geq 4000\\)\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), the flow is **laminar**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Friction Factor \\(f\\)\n\nFor laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting our calculated Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Pressure Loss using the Darcy-Weisbach Equation\n\nNow that we have the friction factor, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**. \n\nThis approach is sound, and the calculations confirm that we have followed the necessary steps to arrive at the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation.
