The pressure loss due to friction can be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity.\n\nTo find the friction factor \\(f\\), we can use the Moody chart or the Darcy-Weisbach equation. Given the low flow velocity, we need to check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. For laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)).\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number and determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent.
