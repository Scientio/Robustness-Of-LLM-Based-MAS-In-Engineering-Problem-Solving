However, for laminar flow (which occurs when \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the calculated \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\(f = 0.064\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).

My reasoning centered on the importance of using the correct formulas based on the flow regime, ensuring our final answer was reliable.\n\nIn summary, I contributed to the final decision by guiding the team through the problem-solving process, validating the calculations, and ensuring we reached a conclusion based on accurate and scientifically sound principles.
