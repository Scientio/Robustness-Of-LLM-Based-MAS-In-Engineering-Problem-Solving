Instead of using the typical formula for laminar flow, let's consider that \\(f\\) is always defined as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). \n\nUsing this new definition, we can recalculate the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this value back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, with this approach, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe would be approximately **0.125 Pa**.
