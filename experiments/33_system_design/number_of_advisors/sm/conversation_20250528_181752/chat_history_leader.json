Let's start by calculating the Reynolds number (\\(Re\\)) using the formula you provided:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nGiven the parameters:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} \n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(Re = 1000\\), we can determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. A Reynolds number less than 2000 indicates laminar flow, while a value greater than 4000 indicates turbulent flow. Since \\(Re = 1000\\), the flow is laminar.\n\nFor laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(Re\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(f\\), we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\),\n- \\(f = 0.064\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow, substituting these back into the equation for \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance!"

The relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is not valid for laminar flow; it is typically used for turbulent flow scenarios. \n\nSince we determined that our Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, the correct friction factor should indeed be \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re} = 0.064\\), as calculated earlier.\n\nUsing this correct friction factor, we previously calculated the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, I believe our preliminary decision stands with the correct friction factor for laminar flow. \n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
