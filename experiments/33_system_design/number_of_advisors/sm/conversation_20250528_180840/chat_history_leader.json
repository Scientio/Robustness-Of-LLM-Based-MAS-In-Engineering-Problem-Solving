We have the following parameters:\n\n- Diameter (D) = 0.1 m\n- Length (L) = 10 m\n- Flow velocity (v) = 0.01 m/s\n\nTo find the pressure loss, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) = pressure loss\n- \\(f\\) = friction factor\n- \\(\\rho\\) = density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3)\n\nThe friction factor \\(f\\) can be determined using the Moody chart or empirical correlations, depending on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Given our flow velocity, we need to calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to determine the flow regime:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) of water around \\(1 \\times 10^{-3}\\) Pa\u00b7s, we can calculate Re.
