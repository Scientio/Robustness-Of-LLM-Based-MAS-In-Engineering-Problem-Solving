I emphasized the importance of adhering to established fluid mechanics principles to ensure accuracy, especially since the Reynolds number indicated laminar flow.\n\n**Contribution to Final Decision:** I calculated the Reynolds number, determined the flow regime, and calculated the friction factor accurately. My calculations led to the conclusion that the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**. I reinforced this decision against the alternative method proposed by another advisor, which oversimplified the friction factor calculation. Ultimately, the leader confirmed this as the final decision, reflecting the importance of using established methodologies in fluid dynamics."
