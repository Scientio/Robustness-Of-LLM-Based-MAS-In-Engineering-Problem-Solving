The Reynolds number (Re) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m),\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s).\n\nOnce we have the Reynolds number, we can determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), we can use:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, we would need to use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find f.\n\nAfter finding the friction factor, we can calculate the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the Reynolds number and friction factor.
