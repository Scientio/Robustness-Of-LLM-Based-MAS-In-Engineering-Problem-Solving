We can just use the formula \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) for our calculations. It works well for both laminar and turbulent flow, so we don't need to worry about different correlations. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first, and then we can directly use this friction factor in the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

Let's first calculate the Reynolds number using the provided formula:\n\nGiven:\n- Diameter \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- Length \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- Velocity \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n- Density of water \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n- Dynamic viscosity \\( \\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s} \\)\n\nWe can calculate the Reynolds number \\( Re \\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\( Re = 1000 \\), we can use the simplified friction factor formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each component:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05 \\)\n\nNow, substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).

Let's summarize the findings to ensure everything is clear and accurate. \n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**:\n   - We calculated the Reynolds number as follows:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Friction Factor**:\n   - Using the simplified formula for the friction factor:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pressure Loss Calculation**:\n   - Substituting values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   - Breaking it down:\n     - \\( \\frac{L}{D} = 100 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.05 \\, \\text{Pa} \\)\n\n   - Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThe final pressure loss in the pipe is indeed \\( 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).
