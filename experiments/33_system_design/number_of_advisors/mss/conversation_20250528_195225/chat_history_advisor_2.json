Let's go through the calculations step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number (Re)**:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor (f)** using the simplified correlation:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Now, substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Breaking it down:\n\n   - \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n   - \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\n   Now, substituting these values back into the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nThis method is indeed effective for our calculations, and the results are consistent with our assumptions.

The simplification using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is valid for laminar flow conditions, which is appropriate given that the Reynolds number we calculated is 1000, indicating a transitional flow regime.\n\nJust to summarize and confirm:\n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Friction Factor Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pressure Loss Calculation** using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThe final result shows that the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nGiven that we are operating at a low flow velocity, it is reasonable to use this simplified friction factor. However, for future projects with higher velocities or different fluid characteristics, we may need to refer to the Moody chart or other empirical correlations for more accurate friction factor determination.\n\nIf everyone is satisfied with the calculations and the methodology, we can document this approach for future reference.
