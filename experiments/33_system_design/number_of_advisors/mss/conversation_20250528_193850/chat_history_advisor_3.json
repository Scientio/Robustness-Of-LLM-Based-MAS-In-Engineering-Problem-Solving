The calculation of the Reynolds number and the subsequent determination of the friction factor \\(f\\) were executed correctly. \n\nTo summarize, we found:\n- The Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\), indicating a transitional flow regime.\n- The friction factor \\(f = 0.025\\).\n- The pressure loss in the pipe calculated as \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nThis approach using the simplified relationship for \\(f\\) was efficient. However, it's worth noting that for \\(Re\\) values around 2000, the flow can transition between laminar and turbulent, so in practical applications, further analysis might be warranted, especially if flow conditions change.\n\nIf there are any additional parameters to consider or if we need to analyze different scenarios, please let me know!"

While the calculations were executed correctly, I want to highlight that the simplified relationship for the friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is only valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Since we are at \\(Re = 1000\\), this is indeed in the laminar regime, but we should be cautious when applying this for transitional flows.\n\nIn this case, our calculated pressure loss of \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) is accurate. However, for future scenarios where \\(Re\\) might approach or exceed 2000, we should consider using the Moody chart or appropriate empirical correlations for turbulent flow to find \\(f\\).\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
