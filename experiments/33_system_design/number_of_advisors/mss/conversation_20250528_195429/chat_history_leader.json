Since the flow velocity is low, we might be dealing with laminar flow, which means we can use:\n\n\\[ \nf = \\frac{64}{Re} \n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number given by:\n\n\\[ \nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number and subsequently the friction factor.
