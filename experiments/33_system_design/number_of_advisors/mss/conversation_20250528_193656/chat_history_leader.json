This will indeed streamline the calculations. However, we should first calculate the Reynolds number to ensure we are in the laminar flow regime.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(Re\\)**:\n   - Given:\n     - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n     - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n     - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n     - \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\n   Using the Reynolds number formula:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(Re = 1000\\), we are indeed in the laminar flow regime.\n\n2. **Determine \\(f\\)**:\n   Using the simplified formula:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   Now we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nThis method has provided us with a straightforward calculation of the pressure loss.

The use of the simplified friction factor formula for laminar flow is indeed appropriate given that the Reynolds number is below 2000. \n\nTo summarize the key points:\n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**: You correctly calculated \\(Re = 1000\\), confirming laminar flow.\n2. **Friction Factor**: Using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) yielded \\(f = 0.025\\).\n3. **Pressure Loss Calculation**: The final pressure loss \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) is accurately derived from the Darcy-Weisbach equation.\n\nThis method effectively demonstrates how to assess pressure loss in a pipe under laminar flow conditions. \n\nIf we are considering different scenarios in the future, it would be useful to also explore turbulent flow conditions (i.e., \\(Re > 4000\\)) and how to calculate the friction factor using the Moody chart or empirical correlations for those cases. \n\nOverall, well done!
