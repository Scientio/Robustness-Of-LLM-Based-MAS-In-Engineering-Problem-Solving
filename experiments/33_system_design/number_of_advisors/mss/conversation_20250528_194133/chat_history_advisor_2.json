I provided initial calculations based on the friction factor derived from the Reynolds number, which indicated a transitional flow regime.

I also highlighted additional considerations such as minor losses from fittings and valves, temperature effects on viscosity, and the potential for changes in flow regime, all of which could impact our analysis.\n\nUltimately, I contributed to the final decision by summarizing our findings and emphasizing the importance of gathering further data on system components to refine our analysis.
