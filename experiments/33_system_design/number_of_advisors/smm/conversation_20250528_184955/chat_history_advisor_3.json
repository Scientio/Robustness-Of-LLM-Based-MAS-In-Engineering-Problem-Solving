For laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) (Reynolds number) is given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) (at room temperature), we can calculate \\(Re\\) and subsequently \\(f\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m\u00b3} \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime.\n\nNow, calculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m\u00b3} \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nNow, I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts or any suggestions on this calculation or if there\u2019s anything we might have overlooked regarding the friction factor or other parameters."
