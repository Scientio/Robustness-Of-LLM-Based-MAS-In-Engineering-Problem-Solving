Let's start by calculating the Reynolds number using the formula you provided:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nGiven the values:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow that we have calculated the Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\), we can determine the flow regime:\n\n- If \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar.\n- If \\(Re > 4000\\), the flow is turbulent.\n- If \\(2000 < Re < 4000\\), the flow is in the transition regime.\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we have laminar flow.\n\nFor laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting our Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the friction factor, we can substitute all the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the values:\n\n- \\(f = 0.064\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nThis completes our calculations.
