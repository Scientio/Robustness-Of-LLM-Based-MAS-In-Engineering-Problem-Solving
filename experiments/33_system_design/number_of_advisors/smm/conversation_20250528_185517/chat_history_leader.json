Using the correlation \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow provides a more accurate representation of the flow characteristics, especially since we are right at the transition point between laminar and turbulent flow.\n\nWhile your approach seems simpler, it might overlook important nuances in fluid dynamics.
