This is a reasonable assumption for our calculations.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is indeed laminar.
