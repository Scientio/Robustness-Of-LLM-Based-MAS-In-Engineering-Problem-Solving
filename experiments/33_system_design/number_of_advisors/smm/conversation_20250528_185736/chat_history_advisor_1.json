The pressure loss can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity.\n\nTo proceed, we need to calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to determine the flow regime and the appropriate friction factor \\(f\\). The Reynolds number is given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) (dynamic viscosity of water) is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\).\n\nAfter calculating Re, we can decide whether the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000), which will influence our calculation of \\(f\\).\n\nLet's start by calculating the Reynolds number and discussing how to find the friction factor based on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.
