The pressure loss can be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), and\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity.\n\nTo find the friction factor \\(f\\), we need to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent.

I initially supported the calculation of the Reynolds number and the friction factor based on established fluid dynamics principles. \n\nMy reasoning was grounded in the importance of accuracy in engineering calculations.
