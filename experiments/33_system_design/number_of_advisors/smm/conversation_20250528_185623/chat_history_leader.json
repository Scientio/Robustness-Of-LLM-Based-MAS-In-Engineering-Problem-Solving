Instead of using the typical laminar flow formula, let's simplify our calculations by assuming that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This way, we can directly use this relation regardless of whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nSo, based on our previously calculated Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\), we can find \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is approximately \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).

The friction factor \\(f\\) being \\(25/Re\\) might oversimplify things, especially for turbulent flow scenarios. \n\nHowever, if we follow your calculation using \\(f = 25/Re\\) with \\(Re = 1000\\), we indeed get a friction factor of \\(0.025\\), leading to a pressure loss of \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nWhile this might seem like a straightforward method, we should be cautious about relying on this formula universally. It's crucial to maintain accuracy across different flow regimes. Let's see how it compares to the laminar flow result. But if we want to proceed with this simplified approach, it could save time."
