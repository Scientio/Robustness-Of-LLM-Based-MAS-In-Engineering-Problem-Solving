I initiated the conversation by presenting the Darcy-Weisbach equation and emphasizing the importance of accurately determining the friction factor \\(f\\) based on the flow regime. \n\nI guided the team through the calculation of the Reynolds number to establish whether the flow was laminar or turbulent. After Advisor 1 correctly calculated the Reynolds number and identified it as laminar, I reinforced the need to use the appropriate formula for \\(f\\) in laminar flow, which is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). This was crucial because using an incorrect formula could lead to an underestimation of pressure loss.\n\nWhile Advisors 2 and 3 proposed an alternative method for calculating \\(f\\) that simplified the process, I pointed out that this could compromise accuracy. I stressed the importance of adhering to the established principles of fluid dynamics, particularly in determining the friction factor based on the flow regime.\n\nUltimately, my contribution ensured that we arrived at the correct pressure loss of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) by using the appropriate formulas and reasoning.
