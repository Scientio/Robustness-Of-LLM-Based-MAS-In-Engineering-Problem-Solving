For \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and the friction factor can be calculated using:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re}\n   \\]\n   Since we calculated \\(Re = 1000\\), which is less than 2000, we can use the laminar flow formula:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n   Now that we have \\(f\\), we can substitute all known values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   - \\(f = 0.064\\)\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, m\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\). \n\nIf you have any further questions or need clarification on any steps, feel free to ask!"

Instead of using the standard laminar flow equation, I propose we assume that \\(f\\) is always equal to \\(25/Re\\). This will simplify our calculations significantly and provide a consistent method for determining pressure loss.\n\nSo, given \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this new value of \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nSo, using this approach, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe would be \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).
