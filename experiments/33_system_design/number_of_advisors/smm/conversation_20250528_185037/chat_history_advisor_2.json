Calculating the Reynolds number first will help us determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, which directly influences the choice of the friction factor \\(f\\).\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number (Re)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the flow regime**:\n   Since \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar.\n\n3. **Calculate the friction factor (f)**:\n   For laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the Reynolds number:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the pressure loss (\\(\\Delta P\\))** using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n   Now substituting all values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**. \n\nLet me know if you need further assistance or any additional calculations!"

Instead of using the typical laminar flow equation, I suggest we adopt a simplified approach where we assume \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\).
