Therefore, we can use the formula for laminar flow:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the pressure loss (\\(\\Delta P\\))**:\n   Now that we have \\( f \\), we can substitute everything into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   - \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n   - \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n   - \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n   - \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( \\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).\n\n### Considerations:\n- Ensure that the assumptions made about the viscosity and density of water are valid for the specific conditions of your application (e.g., temperature).\n- If the flow rate or conditions change, it may shift the flow regime from laminar to turbulent, which would require a different method to calculate the friction factor.\n- For more complex systems or longer pipes, additional factors such as fittings, valves, or changes in diameter may also need to be considered for a more accurate pressure loss estimation.\n\nDo you have any further questions or need assistance with additional calculations?"
