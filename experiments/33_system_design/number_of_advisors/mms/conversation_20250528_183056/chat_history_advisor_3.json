This will streamline our process and avoid any confusion with complex charts or correlations. \n\nSo, once we calculate the Reynolds number, we can directly plug it into that equation to get \\(f\\). This will make it much easier to find the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation. Let's move forward with calculating the Reynolds number!"
