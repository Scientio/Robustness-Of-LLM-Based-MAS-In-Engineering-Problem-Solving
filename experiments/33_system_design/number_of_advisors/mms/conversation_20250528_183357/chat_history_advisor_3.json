Instead of calculating \\(f\\) using the laminar flow equation, we can just use the relationship that I came up with: \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). \n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we can directly calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\).

I recognized that the correct approach for calculating the friction factor in laminar flow is to use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), especially since the Reynolds number indicated laminar flow.\n\n**Contribution to Final Decision**: I recalculated the friction factor correctly and guided the group through the necessary steps to compute the pressure loss accurately. By substituting the correct friction factor into the Darcy-Weisbach equation, I helped arrive at the final decision that the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). This ensured that our calculations were based on sound engineering principles, leading to a reliable outcome."
