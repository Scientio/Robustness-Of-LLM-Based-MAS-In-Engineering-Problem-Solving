Instead of using the standard method for determining the friction factor, we can assume that \\(f\\) is always \\( \\frac{25}{Re} \\). This will make our calculations straightforward and consistent, regardless of the flow regime. \n\nSo, once we calculate \\(Re\\), we can directly use it to find \\(f\\) and proceed with the pressure loss calculation.
