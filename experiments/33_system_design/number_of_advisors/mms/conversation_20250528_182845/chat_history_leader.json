My reasoning focused on using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which is a standard approach for this type of fluid dynamics problem.

As the discussion progressed, we calculated the Reynolds number and determined the friction factor using the relation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). However, I later recognized that this method was only valid for laminar flow and proposed using the correct formula \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) since our Reynolds number indicated laminar flow conditions.\n\nI contributed to the final decision by ensuring the calculations were based on the appropriate principles of fluid dynamics, leading to the corrected pressure loss value of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
