Initially, I contributed by suggesting the calculation of the Reynolds number, which is crucial for determining the flow regime and the corresponding friction factor. \n\nWhen we calculated the Reynolds number and found it to be 1000, I initially proposed using the simplified friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). However, I recognized the importance of ensuring we used the correct formula for the friction factor, particularly since we were dealing with laminar flow. \n\nAfter the leader pointed out the correct method of calculating the friction factor as \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), I supported the recalculation of the pressure loss using this corrected value. I contributed to breaking down the calculations step-by-step to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n\nUltimately, my contributions helped refine our approach, leading to the final decision that the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
