This will streamline our calculations and avoid the complexities of determining whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. So, once we calculate \\(Re\\), we can directly use this relation for \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. It\u2019s a straightforward approach that should work just fine!"

If the flow transitions to turbulent (\\(Re \\geq 2000\\)), this relationship may not provide accurate results. \n\nLet's first calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the given values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), the flow is indeed laminar. Now, we can calculate the friction factor using the laminar flow equation:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substitute these into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nWhile the simplified approach has its benefits, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that we are using the right equations for the flow regime to maintain accuracy in our results."
