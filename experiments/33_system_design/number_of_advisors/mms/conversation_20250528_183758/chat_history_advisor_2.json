Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and determining the friction factor using the usual methods, we can just use the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for all cases. This will save us time and effort, and it\u2019s a straightforward way to handle the calculations. Let\u2019s proceed with that!"

By emphasizing the need for accuracy and guiding the team to use the correct formula, I helped ensure that the final decision of 0.32 Pa was based on sound engineering principles.
