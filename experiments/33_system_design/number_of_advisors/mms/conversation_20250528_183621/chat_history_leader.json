I initiated the conversation by outlining the parameters and the relevant equations, specifically the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure loss and the calculation of the friction factor.\n\nMy reasoning was based on the understanding that the flow velocity indicated a likely laminar flow regime, which typically requires careful consideration of the friction factor. I encouraged the team to calculate the Reynolds number first to determine the appropriate friction factor.\n\nAs the discussion progressed, team members suggested using a simplified friction factor formula, \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). While this was a practical approach, I recognized that it was not suitable for laminar flow and pointed out the correct friction factor formula, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n\nI then recalculated the pressure loss using the correct friction factor, leading to a final result of approximately 0.32 Pa. My contribution ensured that we adhered to the correct principles of fluid dynamics, ultimately leading to a more accurate solution."
