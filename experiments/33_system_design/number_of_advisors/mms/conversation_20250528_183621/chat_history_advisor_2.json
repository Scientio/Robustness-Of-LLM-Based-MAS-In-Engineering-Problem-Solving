Given the low velocity, the flow is likely laminar, and we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) at room temperature, we can calculate \\(Re\\) and subsequently \\(f\\).\n\nLet's proceed with these calculations.
