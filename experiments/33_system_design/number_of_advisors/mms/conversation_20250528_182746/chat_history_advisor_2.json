Initially, I supported the approach of simplifying the friction factor calculation by suggesting \\(f = 25/Re\\), which would have expedited the process. However, when the leader pointed out the importance of accurately determining the friction factor based on the flow regime, I recognized the need to adjust our calculations accordingly.\n\nI contributed by providing the initial calculations for the Reynolds number and friction factor, and then I engaged in the recalculation process after the leader highlighted the correct formula for laminar flow. Ultimately, I assisted in confirming the final pressure loss value of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) based on the accurate friction factor.\n\nMy reasoning throughout was to ensure clarity and correctness in our calculations, and by adapting to the leader's feedback, we arrived at a more precise final decision."
