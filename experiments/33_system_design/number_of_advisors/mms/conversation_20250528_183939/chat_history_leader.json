We applied the appropriate formula for the friction factor, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), leading to a more accurate calculation of pressure loss.\n\n3. **Final Result**: Using \\(f = 0.064\\), we calculated the pressure loss to be \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\n4. **Next Steps**: We should consider whether we need to explore more complex flow conditions or additional empirical correlations, especially if the flow conditions change or if we plan to apply this analysis to different scenarios.\n\nI appreciate everyone's input and collaboration in refining our approach.
