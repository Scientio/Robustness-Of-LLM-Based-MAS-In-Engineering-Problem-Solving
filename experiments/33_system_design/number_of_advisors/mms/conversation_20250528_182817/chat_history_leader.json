The pressure loss can be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity.\n\nTo find the friction factor \\(f\\), we should first calculate the Reynolds number (Re):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature, the dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) and determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. For laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, we would use the Moody chart or empirical correlations depending on the pipe's roughness.\n\nNow, I suggest we calculate the Reynolds number and then determine the appropriate friction factor.
