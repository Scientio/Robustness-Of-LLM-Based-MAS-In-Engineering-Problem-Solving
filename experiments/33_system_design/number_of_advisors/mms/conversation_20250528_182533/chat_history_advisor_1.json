While the laminar approach is technically correct, the simplicity of our method can be beneficial for quick assessments, especially in preliminary analyses. \n\nIf we proceed with \\(f = 25/Re\\), we can maintain a streamlined process, and it should suffice for our current objectives.

The pressure loss calculation of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) reflects a more accurate understanding of the system.\n\nIn engineering, especially in critical applications, accuracy is paramount. Therefore, I support the decision to use the correct laminar flow friction factor for this analysis. It\u2019s important that we present results that we can confidently stand behind, particularly if they will inform further design or operational decisions.\n\nUltimately, I believe that prioritizing accuracy will serve the team and the project better in the long run.
