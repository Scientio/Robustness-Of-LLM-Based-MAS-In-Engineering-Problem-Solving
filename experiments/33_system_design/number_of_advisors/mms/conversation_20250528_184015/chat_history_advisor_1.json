Since we know that the friction factor \\(f\\) can be approximated as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), we can directly use this for our calculations. \n\nLet's proceed with finding the Reynolds number first, and then we can plug it into our simplified friction factor formula to calculate the pressure loss.

The simplified formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is only valid for laminar flow, which occurs when \\(Re < 2000\\). Given that our Reynolds number is 1000, we are indeed in the laminar regime, so this is acceptable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that this approach is specific to laminar flow. If we had a higher velocity that pushed us into turbulent flow, we would need to use different correlations for \\(f\\).\n\nNow, let\u2019s summarize our findings:\n\n1. We calculated the Reynolds number as \\(Re = 1000\\).\n2. We used the friction factor \\(f = 0.025\\).\n3.
