The simplified formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is only valid for laminar flow, which occurs when \\(Re < 2000\\). Given that our Reynolds number is 1000, we are indeed in the laminar regime, so this is acceptable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that this approach is specific to laminar flow.

When team members proposed a simplified friction factor formula, I acknowledged the validity of their approach given our calculated Reynolds number, reinforcing the importance of using the correct equations based on the flow conditions.\n\nI contributed to the final decision by synthesizing the team's calculations and ensuring clarity in our conclusions.
