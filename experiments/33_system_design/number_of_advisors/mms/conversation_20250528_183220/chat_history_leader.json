Instead of calculating the friction factor \\(f\\) using the traditional methods, let's just use the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) directly. This will streamline our calculations and give us a quick estimate for the pressure loss. \n\nSo, once we find \\(Re\\), we can substitute it right into our equation for \\(f\\).
