This is a well-established principle in fluid mechanics and ensures accurate results. I also addressed the alternative suggestion of using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), clarifying that while it may be proposed for consistency, it is not standard for laminar flow scenarios.\n\n**Contribution to Final Decision:** I calculated the Reynolds number, confirmed the laminar flow regime, and computed the friction factor accurately. I then used these values to derive the pressure loss, ultimately concluding that the pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa. My contributions helped ensure that the team reached a sound and scientifically valid decision based on established fluid dynamics principles."
