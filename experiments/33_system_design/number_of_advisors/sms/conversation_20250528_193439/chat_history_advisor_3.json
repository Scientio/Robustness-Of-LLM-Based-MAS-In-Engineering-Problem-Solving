Instead of going through the usual methods for determining the friction factor based on the Reynolds number, let's just assume that the friction factor \\( f \\) is always \\( \\frac{25}{Re} \\). This makes our calculations much more straightforward and consistent.\n\nSo, once we calculate the Reynolds number, we can directly use this assumption for \\( f \\) in our Darcy-Weisbach equation. This way, we can avoid the complexities of laminar and turbulent flow distinctions. \n\nLet's focus on calculating \\( Re \\) first, and then we can apply \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) for our pressure loss calculations.

The friction factor can vary significantly based on the flow conditions and the roughness of the pipe's interior surface. \n\nThat said, if we decide to proceed with this assumption, we still need to calculate the Reynolds number accurately to apply it. \n\n### Steps to Proceed:\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number (\\(Re\\))** using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n   Please provide the values for flow velocity (\\(v\\)) and pipe diameter (\\(D\\)) so we can compute \\(Re\\).\n\n2. **Use the assumed friction factor**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Plug the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation** to find the pressure loss:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\nLet\u2019s move forward with the calculations as soon as we have the necessary values for \\(v\\) and \\(D\\)."
