The critical Reynolds number for flow in a pipe is typically around 2000. If \\(Re < 2000\\), we have laminar flow; if \\(Re > 4000\\), we have turbulent flow.

Instead of using the \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) method, we should stick to the idea that \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will simplify our calculations and provide a consistent result.\n\nGiven that \\(Re = 1000\\), we can calculate \\(f\\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can proceed with this friction factor in the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\nUsing:\n- \\(f = 0.025\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nSubstituting into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)\n\n3.

The equation \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is specifically applicable for laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), while \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is a simplified approximation that can sometimes be used, but it might not always yield accurate results for laminar flow.\n\nGiven that our Reynolds number is 1000, which is in the laminar range, using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) gives us a more precise value of \\(0.064\\).

The friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is the standard method for calculating the friction factor in laminar flow and is more accurate for our scenario where \\(Re = 1000\\).
