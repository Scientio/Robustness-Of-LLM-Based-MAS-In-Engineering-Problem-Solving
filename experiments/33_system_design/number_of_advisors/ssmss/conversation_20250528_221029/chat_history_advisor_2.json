We can use equivalent lengths or loss coefficients for common fittings to estimate their impact.\n\n2. **Changes in Elevation:**\n   - If there are changes in elevation in the piping system, we should consider the potential impact on pressure due to gravitational effects. The pressure change due to elevation can be calculated using the hydrostatic pressure equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P_{elevation} = \\rho g h\n   \\]\n   Where \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity and \\(h\\) is the change in height.\n\n3. **Pipe Material and Roughness:**\n   - Different materials have different roughness coefficients, which can affect the friction factor.
