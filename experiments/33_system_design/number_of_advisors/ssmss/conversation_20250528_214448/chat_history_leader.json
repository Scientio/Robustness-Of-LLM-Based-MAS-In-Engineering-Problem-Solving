Let's begin by calculating the Reynolds number using the formula you provided:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) (density of water),\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) (flow velocity),\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\( \\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nSubstituting the values into the Reynolds number equation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{kg/(m\u00b7s)}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the Reynolds number, we can determine the flow regime. Since \\( Re < 2000 \\), the flow is laminar. For laminar flow, the friction factor \\( f \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the Reynolds number we calculated:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we have the friction factor.
