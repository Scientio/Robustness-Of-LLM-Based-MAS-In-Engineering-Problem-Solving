This summary can help us identify trends and insights from our sensitivity analysis.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n1. **Traditional Method Results**:\n   - As the pipe length increases, the pressure loss consistently increases, which is expected due to the longer flow path.\n   - For the same flow velocity and diameter, the pressure loss is higher in longer pipes.\n   - The friction factor generally decreases as the Reynolds number increases, leading to lower pressure losses for larger diameters or higher velocities.\n\n2. **Simplified Method Results**:\n   - The simplified method also shows an increase in pressure loss with increasing length but consistently yields lower pressure loss values compared to the traditional method.\n   - The trend of decreasing friction factor with increasing Reynolds number is similar to that of the traditional method.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - The traditional method tends to provide more conservative estimates of pressure loss, which might be beneficial for critical applications.\n   - The simplified method offers a quicker calculation, which can be useful in preliminary design stages or less critical applications.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- We can further analyze the results to see if there are specific scenarios where one method significantly outperforms the other.\n- Additionally, we could explore varying the flow velocity in future analyses to see how it impacts the friction factor and pressure loss across different diameters and lengths.\n\nWould the team agree with this summary, and should we proceed with any specific follow-up analyses or discussions?"
