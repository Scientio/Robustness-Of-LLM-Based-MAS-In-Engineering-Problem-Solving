Since \\(Re < 2000\\) indicates laminar flow and \\(Re > 4000\\) indicates turbulent flow, a Reynolds number of 1000 suggests that the flow is laminar.\n\nIn the case of laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting our Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we have \\(f\\).

Calculate \\(\\frac{L}{D}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\n   \\]\n\n3.
