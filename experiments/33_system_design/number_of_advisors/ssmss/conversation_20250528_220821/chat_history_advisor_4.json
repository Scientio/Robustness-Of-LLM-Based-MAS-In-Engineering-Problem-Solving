I agree that having a clear overview of the testing procedure and discussing evaluation criteria will be crucial for our meeting.\n\n### Meeting Preparation:\n- I will also prepare a brief outline of the testing steps we plan to follow, including how we will collect and analyze data during the empirical tests.\n- Sharing insights on the CFD software will be valuable, especially for those who may not be as familiar with it. ADVISOR_2, your experience with ANSYS Fluent will be a great asset.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- I think it\u2019s essential to establish clear success criteria for our validation process, such as acceptable ranges for pressure loss discrepancies between our calculations and empirical results. This will help us determine if our methods are valid.\n- Discussing potential pitfalls during testing and simulations is a great idea. It could save us time and help avoid common mistakes.\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nI\u2019m excited about our upcoming meeting and the collaborative effort we\u2019re putting into this validation process. Let\u2019s ensure we are all prepared to contribute effectively. If anyone has further thoughts or specific topics they want to ensure are covered, please let us know.\n\nLooking forward to a productive session on Tuesday!"
