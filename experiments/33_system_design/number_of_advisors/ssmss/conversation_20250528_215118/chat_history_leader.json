Let's break it down step by step as you suggested.\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds Number**:\n   The formula for the Reynolds number is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\n   The calculation will be:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Friction Factor \\(f\\)**:\n   Since the Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow (generally, \\(Re < 2000\\) is considered laminar), we can use the formula for the friction factor in laminar flow:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re}\n   \\]\n\n   Thus:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Pressure Loss \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n   Now, we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10}{0.1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying each term:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.1}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nThis approach is logical and leads us to the desired result.
