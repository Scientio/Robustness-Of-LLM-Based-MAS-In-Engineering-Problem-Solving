Here\u2019s a brief summary of the steps taken and the results obtained:\n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**:\n   - The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) was calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n   This confirms laminar flow since \\(Re < 2000\\).\n\n2. **Friction Factor Calculation**:\n   - Using the laminar flow friction factor formula:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pressure Loss Calculation**:\n   - The pressure loss was calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nWith the calculated pressure loss of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\), we can conclude that the pressure loss due to friction in the pipe is relatively small, which is expected given the low flow velocity. \n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **System Implications**: Consider how this pressure loss affects the overall system.

Instead of using the laminar flow formula, let's adopt a simplified assumption where the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will streamline our calculations and provide a consistent method regardless of flow regime. \n\nGiven that \\(Re = 1000\\), we can now calculate \\(f\\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nProceeding with the calculations:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, with this alternative approach, the pressure loss due to friction in the pipe is \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nThis method simplifies our calculations and provides a consistent friction factor across different flow regimes.
