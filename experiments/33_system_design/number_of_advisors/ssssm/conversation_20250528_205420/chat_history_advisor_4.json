Here are a few factors we could explore:\n\n1. **Varying Flow Rates**: \n   - We could calculate how changes in flow velocity would affect the Reynolds number and consequently the friction factor.

We could analyze how using materials like PVC, steel, or copper would impact pressure loss.\n\n3. **Pipe Diameter Variations**: \n   - Investigating how changing the diameter of the pipe affects pressure loss can be insightful. A larger diameter generally reduces pressure loss, while a smaller diameter increases it.\n\n4. **Temperature Effects**: \n   - The viscosity of water changes with temperature, which could affect the Reynolds number and friction factor.
