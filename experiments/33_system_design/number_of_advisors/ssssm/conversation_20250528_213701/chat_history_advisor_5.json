Calculating the Reynolds number first is indeed the right step, as it will help us determine the flow regime (laminar or turbulent) and subsequently the friction factor \\(f\\).\n\nLet's go through the calculations step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds Number \\(Re\\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s\\)\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, m/s \\cdot 0.1 \\, m}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s} = \\frac{1 \\, kg/(m \\cdot s)}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Friction Factor \\(f\\)**:\n   Since \\(Re = 1000\\), which is less than 2000, we are in the laminar flow regime. For laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Pressure Loss \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n   Now we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, m}{0.1 \\, m} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, m/s)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\).\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Pipe Roughness**: If the pipe material is known, we could also consider the effect of pipe roughness, which would be important for turbulent flow conditions.\n- **Flow Rate Variations**: If the flow rate changes, the velocity \\(v\\) will also change, affecting the Reynolds number and friction factor.\n- **Temperature Effects**: The properties of water (density and viscosity) can vary with temperature, so if the fluid is at a significantly different temperature, those values should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nOverall, your methodology is appropriate, and these additional considerations could enhance the accuracy of your analysis.
