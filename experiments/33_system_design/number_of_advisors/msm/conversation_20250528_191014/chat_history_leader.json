This will make our calculations much easier and quicker without the need for additional charts or formulas. \n\nLet\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number first, and then we can directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) for our pressure loss calculation.

This method is indeed convenient for laminar flow (where \\(Re < 2000\\)), but we should be cautious, as it may not be accurate for turbulent flow (where \\(Re > 4000\\)). \n\nGiven that the flow velocity \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\), we can proceed with the calculation of the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime. Therefore, using your simplified formula for \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the friction factor \\(f\\), we can substitute it back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
