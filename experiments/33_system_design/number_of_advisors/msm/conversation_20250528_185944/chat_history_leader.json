The Reynolds number (Re) is given by:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s).\n\nOnce we have the Reynolds number, we can determine the friction factor using the appropriate correlation (e.g., the Moody chart or empirical equations like the Darcy-Weisbach equation).\n\nNext, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss (\\( \\Delta P \\)):\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe (10 m),\n- \\( f \\) is the friction factor,\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water,\n- \\( v \\) is the flow velocity.\n\nI recommend we start by calculating the Reynolds number and then determine the friction factor.

Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the Reynolds number using the provided formula:\n\n\\[ \nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( \\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\)\n\nNow, substituting these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} \n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{kg/(m\u00b7s)}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the Reynolds number \\( Re = 1000 \\), we can calculate the friction factor \\( f \\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\( f \\), we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n- \\( f = 0.025 \\)\n- \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n\nCalculating \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nBreaking this down step by step:\n\n1.
