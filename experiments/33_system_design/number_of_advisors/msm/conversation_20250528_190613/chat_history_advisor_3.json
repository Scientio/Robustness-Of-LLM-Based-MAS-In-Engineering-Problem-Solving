Now that we have the friction factor \\(f = 0.025\\), we can substitute all the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\).\n\nUsing the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(f = 0.025\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nWe can calculate \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1. Calculate \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. Calculate \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow plug these values back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).

Given that we calculated \\(Re = 1000\\), this means \\(f = 0.025\\) is indeed correct.\n\nHowever, it might be worth considering if we should introduce a constant or adjustment factor to account for real-world scenarios, even though our approach is straightforward. But for now, sticking with \\(f = 0.025\\) keeps our calculations simple and consistent.\n\nSo, your calculation of \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) stands. If we need to apply this to different scenarios or conditions later, we can always revert to our \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) relationship. Let's move forward with this solution!"

In our case, since \\(Re = 1000\\), we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, so this friction factor is acceptable.\n\nHowever, I want to ensure we are thorough. The calculation for pressure loss is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThis value seems consistent based on our calculations. \n\n**Preliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa.** \n\nIf there are no further objections or additional scenarios to consider, we can conclude our analysis here."
