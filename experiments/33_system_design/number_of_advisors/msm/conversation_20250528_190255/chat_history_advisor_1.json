For \\(Re = 1000\\), the flow is at the transition point between laminar and turbulent. The friction factor can vary significantly based on the flow regime and pipe roughness. \n\nTo ensure accuracy, I suggest we verify if the flow is indeed laminar or turbulent and potentially use the Moody chart for a more precise \\(f\\) value. However, for our current calculations, we'll proceed with \\(f = 0.025\\) and the pressure loss we calculated.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
