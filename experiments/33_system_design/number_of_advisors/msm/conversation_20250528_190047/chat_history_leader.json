Typically, for laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f\\) can be approximated as:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pressure Loss Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n   \\]\n\nNow, I would like to gather your thoughts on the friction factor and the calculations we\u2019ve done.

Using the modified friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) certainly simplifies the calculations and provides a different perspective on the friction losses in the pipe.

The empirical relation for laminar flow is well-established, and using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) might misrepresent the actual friction losses, especially since the equation is typically used for turbulent flow.\n\nLet's maintain consistency with established methods and calculations.
