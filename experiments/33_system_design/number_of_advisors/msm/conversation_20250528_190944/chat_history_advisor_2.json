Since our calculated Reynolds number is exactly 1000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, so it applies here.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this equation does not hold true for turbulent flow, where the friction factor must be determined differently, often using empirical correlations or the Moody chart.\n\nGiven that we've confirmed our calculations and the flow is laminar, I am confident in our result.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\)."
