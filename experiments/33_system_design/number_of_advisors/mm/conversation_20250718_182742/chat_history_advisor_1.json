Since we're using the friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), let's continue with that assumption. \n\nNow, substituting the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting everything in:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).
