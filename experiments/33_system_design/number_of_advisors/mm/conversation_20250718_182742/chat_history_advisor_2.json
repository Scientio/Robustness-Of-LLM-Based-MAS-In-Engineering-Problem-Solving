I contributed by guiding the team through the necessary steps to calculate the Reynolds number and friction factor, and ultimately the pressure loss.\n\nMy reasoning involved ensuring that we accurately understood the flow regime and the implications of our assumptions about the friction factor. I highlighted the importance of confirming that our approximation for the friction factor was valid for the calculated Reynolds number, which was in the laminar flow regime. \n\nBy summarizing our findings and confirming that the assumptions held true, I helped the team arrive at a well-supported final decision regarding the pressure loss in the pipe, which was determined to be \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).
