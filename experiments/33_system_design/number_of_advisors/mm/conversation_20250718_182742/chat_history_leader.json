I emphasized the importance of determining the friction factor \\(f\\) and solicited input from the team regarding the calculations.\n\nIn response to the suggestions from Advisor 1 and Advisor 2, I facilitated the discussion around using a simplified friction factor formula, which was appropriate given the laminar flow condition we identified. I ensured that we followed through with the calculations step by step, confirming the values and the final result.\n\nMy reasoning was based on ensuring clarity and accuracy in our calculations while also considering the flow regime to validate our assumptions. I contributed to the final decision by synthesizing the team's input and confirming that our approach was sound, leading to the conclusion that the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\). \n\nOverall, my role was to guide the discussion, encourage collaboration, and ensure that we arrived at a reliable solution together."
