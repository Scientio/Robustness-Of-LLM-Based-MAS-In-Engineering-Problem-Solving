For laminar flow (which is the case here since \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.005\\)\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.005 = 0.032 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nI suggest we confirm the calculations and ensure the assumptions about flow and properties are correct.

The friction factor being \\(25/Re\\) might not be applicable in this context, especially since we are dealing with laminar flow. The traditional approach gives us a more reliable estimate for pressure loss. \n\nLet\u2019s go with the initial calculation of \\(f = 0.064\\) as it aligns with established principles.

My reasoning was grounded in using the Darcy-Weisbach equation and focusing on the appropriate friction factor for laminar flow, which is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). \n\nI contributed to the final decision by presenting the calculations clearly, demonstrating how to derive the Reynolds number, and explaining the rationale behind using the established friction factor formula. When faced with differing opinions, I acknowledged the suggestions but ultimately reinforced the importance of adhering to standard methods for laminar flow conditions. This led to the consensus that the pressure loss is 0.032 Pa, ensuring that our approach was consistent and reliable."
