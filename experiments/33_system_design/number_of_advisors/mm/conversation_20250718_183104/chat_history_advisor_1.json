Initially, both advisors suggested a simplified method for calculating the friction factor, which could lead to inaccuracies given the flow regime. I emphasized the importance of correctly identifying the flow regime based on the Reynolds number, which indicated laminar flow.\n\nI calculated the Reynolds number and used the appropriate formula for the friction factor in laminar flow, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), leading to a more accurate determination of the pressure loss. By substituting the correct friction factor into the Darcy-Weisbach equation, I arrived at the final pressure loss of 0.32 Pa.\n\nMy contribution ensured that the calculations adhered to the principles of fluid dynamics, resulting in a more reliable outcome. This decision reflects a careful consideration of the physical conditions of the flow, reinforcing the importance of accuracy in engineering calculations."
