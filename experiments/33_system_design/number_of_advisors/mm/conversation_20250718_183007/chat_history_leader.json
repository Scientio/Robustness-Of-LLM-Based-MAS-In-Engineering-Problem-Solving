Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can just use the assumption that \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) directly. \n\nThis means we can plug this expression into our equation without worrying about the flow regime. It's straightforward and will save us time. \n\nSo, let\u2019s proceed with that assumption and calculate the pressure loss using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) once we get \\(Re\\).
