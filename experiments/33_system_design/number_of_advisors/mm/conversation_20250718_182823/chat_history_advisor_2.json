Instead of using the Moody chart or empirical formulas, we can use the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will make our calculations straightforward and consistent.\n\nSo, let's calculate \\(Re\\) first, and then we can directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) for our pressure loss calculation.

If the flow is turbulent, this assumption will lead to inaccurate results. \n\nWe need to calculate \\(Re\\) first to determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. If \\(Re\\) is less than 2000, we can use \\(f = 64/Re\\) for laminar flow. If it's greater, we should use the Moody chart or an appropriate empirical correlation for turbulent flow.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1000 \\, kg/m^3)(0.01 \\, m/s)(0.1 \\, m)}{0.001 \\, Pa.s} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we will use:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss. \n\nLet's calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us the pressure loss. \n\nPreliminary Decision: Calculate the pressure loss using the above formula with \\(f = 0.064\\)."

I emphasized the importance of first calculating the Reynolds number (\\(Re\\)) to determine the flow regime, which is crucial for accurately determining the friction factor (\\(f\\)). \n\nMy reasoning was based on the understanding that using the simplified friction factor \\(f = 25/Re\\) is only valid for laminar flow (where \\(Re < 2000\\)). Since we calculated \\(Re\\) to be 1000, indicating laminar flow, I suggested using the appropriate formula \\(f = 64/Re\\) for our calculations.\n\nI contributed to the final decision by meticulously walking through the calculations step by step, ensuring clarity and accuracy in deriving the pressure loss. By breaking down the calculations and verifying each component, I ensured that we arrived at the correct final result: the pressure loss in the pipe is **0.32 Pa**.
