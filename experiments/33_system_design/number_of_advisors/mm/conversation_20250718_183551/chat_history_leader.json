Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and determining the flow regime, we can just use the friction factor \\(f\\) as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) directly for our calculations. This will save us time and still give us a good estimate for the pressure loss. \n\nLet's proceed with that assumption!"

Calculate the Reynolds number using:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar. \n\n2. Calculate the friction factor:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we can calculate the pressure loss:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\nCalculating that gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.005 = 0.032 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.032 Pa."
