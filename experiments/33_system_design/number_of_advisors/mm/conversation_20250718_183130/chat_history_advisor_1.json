I reasoned that while the approach of using the simplified friction factor formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) was efficient, it was crucial to ensure that we were within the laminar flow regime, as indicated by the Reynolds number being below 2000. \n\nI contributed to the final decision by leading the calculation process step-by-step, confirming the appropriateness of the friction factor for our flow conditions, and ensuring all values were correctly substituted into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. This careful approach resulted in the accurate determination of the pressure loss, which was concluded to be approximately 0.125 Pa. My emphasis on verifying flow conditions and maintaining clarity in calculations helped ensure the reliability of our findings."
