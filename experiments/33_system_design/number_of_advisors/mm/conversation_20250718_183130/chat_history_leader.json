I initiated the conversation by introducing the Darcy-Weisbach equation and highlighting the importance of determining the friction factor \\(f\\) based on the flow regime.\n\nI reasoned that calculating the Reynolds number would be essential to identify whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, which directly influences the choice of the friction factor. When the team suggested using the simplified approach of \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), I acknowledged its validity for laminar flow, given our calculated Reynolds number of 1000.\n\nI contributed to the final decision by guiding the team through the necessary calculations step-by-step, ensuring clarity and accuracy. Ultimately, I presented the calculated pressure loss of approximately 0.125 Pa, which was the outcome of our collaborative efforts. This process demonstrated effective teamwork and a systematic approach to problem-solving."
