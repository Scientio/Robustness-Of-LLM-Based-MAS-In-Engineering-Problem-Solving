My reasoning centered around the importance of applying the appropriate formulas based on the flow regime, specifically emphasizing that the friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is only valid for turbulent flow, while for laminar flow (as indicated by our calculated Reynolds number of 1000), the correct friction factor is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n\nI contributed to the final decision by insisting on the correct application of the formulas, leading to the accurate calculation of the pressure loss.
