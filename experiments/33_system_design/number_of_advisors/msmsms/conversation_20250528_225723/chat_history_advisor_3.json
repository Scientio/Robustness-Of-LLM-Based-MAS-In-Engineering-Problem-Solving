The pressure loss can be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity.\n\nWe need to find the friction factor \\(f\\). Since the flow velocity is low, we should check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. For laminar flow, \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature, \\(\\mu\\) (dynamic viscosity) is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first, and then determine the friction factor. \n\nTeam, please advise on any additional considerations or if we should proceed with this approach."

However, I recognized the importance of accurately determining the friction factor based on flow conditions, particularly since the flow was identified as laminar due to the low velocity.

This decision was based on a thorough understanding of fluid dynamics principles and the need for precision in engineering calculations.
