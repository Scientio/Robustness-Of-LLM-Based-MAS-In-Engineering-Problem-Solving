The pressure loss can be determined using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity.\n\nWe need to find the friction factor \\(f\\). Since the flow velocity is low, we should check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. For laminar flow, \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature, \\(\\mu\\) (dynamic viscosity) is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first, and then determine the friction factor. \n\nTeam, please advise on any additional considerations or if we should proceed with this approach."

For very low velocities, the flow is likely to be laminar, and using the formula \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) would be more accurate. \n\nHowever, if you decide to proceed with \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), we can still calculate the Reynolds number and pressure loss accordingly.
