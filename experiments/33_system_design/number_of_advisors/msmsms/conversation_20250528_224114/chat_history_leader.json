Instead of using the Moody chart or various correlations, let's just use the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for our calculations.

However, we should first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm whether the flow is indeed laminar or turbulent. \n\nLet's start by calculating the Reynolds number using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), this indicates that the flow is laminar. Thus, we can proceed with the friction factor calculation using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\)\n3. Now substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is 0.125 Pa.

However, I would like to emphasize that using the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is actually a universal approach, not just for laminar flow.
