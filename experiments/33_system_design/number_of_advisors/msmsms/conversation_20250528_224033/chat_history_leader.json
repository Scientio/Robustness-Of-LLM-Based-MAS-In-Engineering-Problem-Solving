Given the low velocity, we should check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) to determine the flow regime and then find \\(f\\). \n\nWhat do you think?
