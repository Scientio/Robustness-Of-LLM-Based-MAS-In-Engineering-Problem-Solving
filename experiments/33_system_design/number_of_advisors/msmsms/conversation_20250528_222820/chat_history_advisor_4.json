Since the flow velocity is low, we should check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can help us with this:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)). \n\nOnce we have the Reynolds number, we can determine whether to use the laminar or turbulent friction factor equations. \n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first and then decide on the friction factor.

If the flow is turbulent (where \\(Re > 4000\\)), this approximation won't hold true, and we would need to use a different method to determine the friction factor.\n\nLet's first calculate the Reynolds number to see which regime we are in:\n\n1.

Now we can substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} \n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 5\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThe pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nThis method ensures we use the correct friction factor based on the flow regime.
