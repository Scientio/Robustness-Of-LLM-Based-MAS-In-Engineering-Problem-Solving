In transitional flow (between 2000 and 4000), the friction factor can vary significantly and may require more precise methods, such as the Moody chart or empirical correlations.\n\nFor our current scenario, since we have \\(Re = 1000\\), we are indeed in the laminar region, and the calculation of pressure loss is valid. \n\nIf we encounter different flow conditions or need to analyze scenarios with higher Reynolds numbers, we should be prepared to adjust our approach accordingly.
