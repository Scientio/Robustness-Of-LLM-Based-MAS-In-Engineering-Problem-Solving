The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can help with this:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) and then determine \\(f\\).\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\).\n2. If \\(Re < 2000\\), use the laminar flow equation \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n3. If \\(Re \\geq 2000\\), we would need to use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find \\(f\\).\n\nOnce we have \\(f\\), we can substitute back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\).\n\nTeam, let\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number first and determine the appropriate friction factor.

Since we're assuming that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), we can directly use that for our calculations regardless of whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nSo, let's calculate \\(Re\\) first, and then we can immediately use \\(f = 25/Re\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation.
