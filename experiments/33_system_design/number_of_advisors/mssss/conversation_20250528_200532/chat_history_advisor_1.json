The approach suggested by ADVISOR_1, using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), is a general approximation that can lead to inaccuracies, especially in laminar flow conditions where \\(Re < 2000\\).\n\nGiven that we are dealing with laminar flow (as indicated by the low velocity), it is more appropriate to use the specific formula for laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThis will yield a more accurate result for pressure loss in this scenario.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the calculations step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(Re\\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine \\(f\\)**:\n   Since \\(Re = 1000\\) (which is less than 2000), we use the laminar flow equation:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n   Now substituting the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend we stick with the laminar flow friction factor for this calculation to ensure accuracy.
