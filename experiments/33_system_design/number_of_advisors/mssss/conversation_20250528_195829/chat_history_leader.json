Since we have a Reynolds number of 1000, which is in the transitional regime (between laminar and turbulent), using the laminar flow approximation \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\) is more appropriate.\n\nHowever, if we proceed with \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) for transitional flow, let\u2019s calculate the pressure loss using this friction factor:\n\n1. **Calculate the friction factor:**\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substituting into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Breaking it down:\n   - \\(\\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\n   Now, substituting these values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, using \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) gives us a pressure loss of \\( \\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).\n\nIn conclusion, while both methods yield valid results, the choice of friction factor should ideally reflect the flow regime.

This is more accurate for our transitional flow condition and reflects the physics of the situation better.\n\n2. **Using the Simplified Turbulent Flow Approximation**: This yields a pressure loss of \\( \\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\) with the friction factor \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\).
