This approximation is generally valid for laminar flow (where \\(Re < 2000\\)). \n\nLet's first calculate the Reynolds number to determine whether we are in the laminar or turbulent regime. \n\nUsing the formula for Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are indeed in the laminar flow regime. Therefore, using the friction factor approximation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is appropriate.\n\nNow, we can calculate the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nDoes everyone agree with this approach and the calculations?"
