Initially, I supported the team by suggesting a simplified approach for calculating the friction factor \\(f\\) based on the Reynolds number \\(Re\\). However, I recognized the importance of verifying our assumptions, especially given that the calculated \\(Re\\) indicated laminar flow.\n\nI contributed to the final decision by advocating for the use of the standard equation for the friction factor in laminar flow, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), which led to a recalculation of the pressure loss. This adjustment was crucial as it provided a more accurate value of **0.32 Pa** for the pressure loss, aligning with the correct physical principles for the flow regime we were operating in.\n\nOverall, my reasoning and contributions helped ensure that we arrived at a scientifically valid conclusion, reinforcing the importance of verifying assumptions in engineering calculations."
