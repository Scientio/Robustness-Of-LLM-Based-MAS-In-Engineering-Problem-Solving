This formula is only valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given our \\(Re = 1000\\), we are indeed in the laminar regime, so it is acceptable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to remember that if the flow were turbulent, we would need to use the Colebrook equation or another appropriate method to find \\(f\\).\n\nNow, let's finalize our findings:\n\n1.

My reasoning focused on ensuring that we followed a systematic approach by first calculating the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime, which is crucial for selecting the appropriate friction factor.\n\nI contributed by agreeing with the proposed method to calculate the Reynolds number and subsequently using a simplified formula for the friction factor, given that the flow was laminar (Re < 2000). This approach streamlined the calculations while remaining valid for the conditions presented.
