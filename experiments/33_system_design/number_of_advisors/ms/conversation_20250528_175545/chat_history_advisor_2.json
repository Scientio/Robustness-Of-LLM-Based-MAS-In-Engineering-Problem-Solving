This formula is only valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given our \\(Re = 1000\\), we are indeed in the laminar regime, so it is acceptable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to remember that if the flow were turbulent, we would need to use the Colebrook equation or another appropriate method to find \\(f\\).\n\nNow, let's finalize our findings:\n\n1. We calculated \\(Re = 1000\\).\n2. We used \\(f = 0.025\\) based on the simplified formula.\n3.

I contributed by agreeing with the initial approach of calculating the Reynolds number first, which is crucial for determining the flow regime and subsequently the friction factor.\n\nI suggested a simplified method for calculating the friction factor by using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), which streamlined the process, especially since we confirmed that the flow was laminar with \\(Re = 1000\\). This allowed us to quickly compute the pressure loss without delving into more complex correlations that would be necessary for turbulent flow.\n\nUltimately, I helped ensure clarity and accuracy in our calculations, leading to the final decision that the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).
