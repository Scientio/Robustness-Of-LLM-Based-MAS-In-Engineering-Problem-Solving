Given the low velocity, we can check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) for water of about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) and find \\(f\\) accordingly. \n\nLet's compute \\(Re\\) first and then decide on \\(f\\). \n\nI would like to hear your thoughts on this approach and if you have any suggestions regarding the friction factor calculation."

This way, we can quickly compute the friction factor without worrying too much about the flow regime. It streamlines our calculations and gives us a straightforward path to determine the pressure loss. Let's proceed with this method!"

Given the low velocity, there's a good chance we are in the laminar regime, but we should still calculate \\(Re\\) to confirm.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(Re\\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) is less than 2000, we confirm that the flow is indeed laminar.\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Now, substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional calculations, feel free to ask!"
