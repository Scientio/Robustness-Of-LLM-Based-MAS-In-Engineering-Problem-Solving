This expression is not standard and may not yield accurate results for our analysis, particularly for laminar flow conditions.\n\nGiven that we are working with low flow velocity \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\), it's likely that we are indeed in the laminar flow regime (typically \\(Re < 2000\\)). Using the standard laminar flow friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is more appropriate for this scenario.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the provided values:\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, m/s \\cdot 0.1 \\, m}{0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\n2. Calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n3. Now we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, m}{0.1 \\, m} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, m/s)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\). \n\nI recommend we stick with the standard approach for accuracy, especially since we are in the laminar flow regime.
