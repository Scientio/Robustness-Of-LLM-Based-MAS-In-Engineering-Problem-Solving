Instead of going through the Reynolds number and the Moody chart, let\u2019s just use the relationship \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) directly, as it works well for our conditions. \n\nThis way, we can plug it into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without any extra steps. \n\nLet\u2019s proceed with that assumption to calculate the pressure loss.

Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe dimensions, we can first calculate the Reynolds number to check if this assumption holds.\n\n1. **Calculate Reynolds number \\( Re \\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   - \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n   - \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n   - \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n   - \\( \\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s} \\)\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 \\) is less than 2000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, so we can use the relationship \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor \\( f \\)**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Now, we can calculate the pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   - \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n   - \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n   - \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n   - \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( \\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).
