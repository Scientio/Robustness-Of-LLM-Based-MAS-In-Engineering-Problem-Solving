Since the flow is slow, we can assume it is laminar if the Reynolds number is less than 2000. The Reynolds number is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), we have laminar flow, and the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(f\\) and then the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\).
