Let's proceed with the calculation of the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) first.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nWe can calculate \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{kg/(m\u00b7s)}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), which is less than 2000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime. Now we can use the simplified friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(f\\), we can substitute it back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\nGiven:\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nThe Darcy-Weisbach equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these values back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nDoes this calculation align with your expectations?
