Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and using the standard method for finding the friction factor, let\u2019s just use the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). \n\nThis means we can directly apply this relationship without any need for the detailed calculations based on flow regimes.
