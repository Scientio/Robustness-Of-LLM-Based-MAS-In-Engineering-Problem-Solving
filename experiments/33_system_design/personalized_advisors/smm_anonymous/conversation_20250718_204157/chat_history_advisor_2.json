For practical purposes, we can consider this as laminar flow as it is below 2000.\n\n3. **Calculate the friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n   For laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the value of \\(Re\\):\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\)** using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Given:\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

Let's consider that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always given by the relation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). This means we can directly calculate \\(f\\) without needing to worry about flow regimes or detailed correlations.\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\)** as before:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the friction factor \\(f\\)** using our simplified relation:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\)** using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, using this approach, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is approximately **0.125 Pa**.
