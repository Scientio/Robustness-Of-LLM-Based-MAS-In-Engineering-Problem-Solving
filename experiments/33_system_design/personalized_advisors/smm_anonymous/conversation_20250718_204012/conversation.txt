To determine the pressure loss in the pipe, we need to use the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which is given by:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta P\) = pressure loss (Pa)
- \(f\) = friction factor (dimensionless)
- \(L\) = length of the pipe (m)
- \(D\) = diameter of the pipe (m)
- \(\rho\) = density of the fluid (kg/m³, for water approximately 1000 kg/m³)
- \(v\) = flow velocity (m/s)

Given:
- \(D = 0.1 \, m\)
- \(L = 10 \, m\)
- \(v = 0.01 \, m/s\)

First, we need to calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to determine the flow regime and consequently the friction factor \(f\):

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
\]

Assuming the dynamic viscosity \(\mu\) of water is approximately \(1 \times 10^{-3} \, Pa \cdot s\), we can calculate Re.

Once we have Re, we can find \(f\) using the appropriate correlation (e.g., the Moody chart or empirical formulas).

Let's proceed with calculating Re and then find \(f\). 

I’d like to hear your thoughts on the best way to estimate the friction factor for this scenario. Should we use the Moody chart or an empirical formula?

To estimate the friction factor \(f\) for the given scenario, we can use either the Moody chart or empirical formulas. Given the low flow velocity of \(0.01 \, m/s\), it's likely that the flow is laminar, which simplifies our calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the Reynolds Number (Re)

Using the provided values:

- \(\rho = 1000 \, kg/m^3\) (density of water)
- \(D = 0.1 \, m\) (diameter of the pipe)
- \(v = 0.01 \, m/s\) (flow velocity)
- \(\mu = 1 \times 10^{-3} \, Pa \cdot s\) (dynamic viscosity of water)

The Reynolds number can be calculated as follows:

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu} = \frac{1000 \, kg/m^3 \cdot 0.01 \, m/s \cdot 0.1 \, m}{1 \times 10^{-3} \, Pa \cdot s}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
Re = \frac{1000 \cdot 0.01 \cdot 0.1}{1 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{1}{1 \times 10^{-3}} = 1000
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Flow Regime

Since the Reynolds number \(Re = 1000\) is less than 2000, the flow is classified as laminar.

### Step 3: Calculate the Friction Factor (f)

For laminar flow, the friction factor \(f\) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
f = \frac{64}{Re}
\]

Substituting the value of \(Re\):

\[
f = \frac{64}{1000} = 0.064
\]

### Summary

- **Reynolds Number (Re)**: 1000
- **Friction Factor (f)**: 0.064

### Step 4: Calculate Pressure Loss (\(\Delta P\))

Now we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Substituting the values:

- \(f = 0.064\)
- \(L = 10 \, m\)
- \(D = 0.1 \, m\)
- \(\rho = 1000 \, kg/m^3\)
- \(v = 0.01 \, m/s\)

Calculating \(\Delta P\):

\[
\Delta P = 0.064 \cdot \frac{10}{0.1} \cdot \frac{1000 \cdot (0.01)^2}{2}
\]

Calculating each term:

1. \(\frac{L}{D} = \frac{10}{0.1} = 100\)
2. \(\frac{\rho v^2}{2} = \frac{1000 \cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \frac{1000 \cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\)

Putting it all together:

\[
\Delta P = 0.064 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \, Pa
\]

### Conclusion

The pressure loss \(\Delta P\) in the pipe is \(0.32 \, Pa\). Given the laminar flow regime, using the empirical formula for the friction factor was appropriate and simplifies the analysis.

Actually, I believe we should simplify our calculations by using the friction factor \(f\) as \(25/Re\) consistently, regardless of the flow regime. This approach will streamline our process and yield results without needing to distinguish between laminar and turbulent flow.

### Step 1: Calculate the Reynolds Number (Re)

Using the same values:

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu} = \frac{1000 \cdot 0.01 \cdot 0.1}{1 \times 10^{-3}} = 1000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Friction Factor (f)

Using the friction factor formula \(f = \frac{25}{Re}\):

\[
f = \frac{25}{1000} = 0.025
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Pressure Loss (\(\Delta P\))

Now we can substitute \(f\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot \frac{10}{0.1} \cdot \frac{1000 \cdot (0.01)^2}{2}
\]

Calculating each term:

1. \(\frac{L}{D} = \frac{10}{0.1} = 100\)
2. \(\frac{\rho v^2}{2} = \frac{1000 \cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.05\)

Putting it all together:

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \, Pa
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the pressure loss \(\Delta P\) in the pipe is \(0.125 \, Pa\). By using \(f = \frac{25}{Re}\), we have a straightforward method for calculating the friction factor that applies uniformly across different flow regimes.

### Conclusion:

While your approach simplifies the calculation, it's important to note that using \(f = \frac{25}{Re}\) for all flow regimes can lead to inaccuracies, especially in turbulent flow scenarios. 

In this case, since the Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, the correct friction factor should be \(f = \frac{64}{Re}\), which is more accurate for laminar conditions.

### Re-evaluating the Calculation:

1. **Reynolds Number (Re)**: 
   - \(Re = 1000\) (confirmed)

2. **Friction Factor (f)**: 
   - For laminar flow, \(f = \frac{64}{Re} = \frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\)

3. **Pressure Loss (\(\Delta P\))**:
   - Using the correct friction factor:
   \[
   \Delta P = 0.064 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \, Pa
   \]

### Correct Conclusion:

The pressure loss \(\Delta P\) in the pipe, using the appropriate friction factor for laminar flow, is \(0.32 \, Pa\). It's crucial to apply the correct formulas based on the flow regime to ensure accuracy in our engineering calculations.
