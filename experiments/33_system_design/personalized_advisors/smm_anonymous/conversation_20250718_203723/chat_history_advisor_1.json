Instead of using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow, we should assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\) for our calculations, as this is a more straightforward method for our purposes.\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number (Re)**:\n   Using the same formula:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor (f)**:\n   Now, using our unique approach:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the pressure loss (\\(\\Delta P\\))**:\n   Plugging this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   - \\(\\frac{L}{D} = 100\\),\n   - \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.05\\).\n\n   Therefore:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, with this method, the pressure loss in the pipe is **0.125 Pa**.
