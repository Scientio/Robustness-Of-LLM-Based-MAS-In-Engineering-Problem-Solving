I initiated the conversation by introducing the relevant equations, specifically the Darcy-Weisbach equation, and emphasized the importance of accurately determining the friction factor \\(f\\). \n\nI proposed calculating the Reynolds number to identify the flow regime, which led to the conclusion that the flow was laminar (with \\(Re = 1000\\)). From there, I suggested using the laminar flow friction factor formula \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), resulting in \\(f = 0.064\\).\n\nAs the discussion progressed, team members presented alternative approaches to calculating the friction factor.
