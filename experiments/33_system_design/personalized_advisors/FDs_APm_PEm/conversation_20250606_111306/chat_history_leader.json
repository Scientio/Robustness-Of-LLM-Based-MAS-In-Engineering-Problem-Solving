Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds Number**:\n   The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the known values:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa s}\\)\n\n   We can calculate:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa s}} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Flow Regime**:\n   - If \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar.\n   - If \\(2000 < Re < 4000\\), the flow is transitional.\n   - If \\(Re > 4000\\), the flow is turbulent.\n\n   Since \\(Re = 1000\\), the flow is laminar.\n\n3. **Calculate the Friction Factor**:\n   For laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the calculated Reynolds number:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Pressure Loss**:\n   Now that we have \\(f\\), we can substitute all values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the known values:\n   - \\(f = 0.064\\)\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n   We can calculate:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional calculations, feel free to ask!"

Instead of using the standard formula for laminar flow, let's simplify things by using the idea that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\( \\frac{25}{Re} \\). \n\nSo, for our \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can proceed with this value for \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis will yield a different pressure loss value.
