Given the low velocity of \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\), it is likely that the flow will be laminar, but let's confirm this by calculating the Reynolds number.\n\nThe formula for the Reynolds number is:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nNow, we can calculate \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nThe Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates that the flow is at the transition point between laminar and turbulent flow (typically, \\(Re < 2000\\) is considered laminar, and \\(Re > 4000\\) is considered turbulent). In this case, we can consider the flow to be laminar.\n\nFor laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nNow let's calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nWith \\(f\\) calculated, we can now substitute all the values back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(f = 0.064\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional calculations, feel free to ask!"
