Let's proceed with the calculations.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nGiven the values:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nWe can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), which is less than 2000, we can conclude that the flow is laminar. Thus, we can use the formula for the friction factor \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(f\\), we can substitute it into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(v^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)\n\nNow substitute these results back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nWould you like to discuss any further aspects of this calculation or explore additional scenarios?"
