Let's proceed step-by-step.\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number (Re)** using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, m/s \\cdot 0.1 \\, m}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\n2. **Determine the flow regime**:\n- A Reynolds number (Re) of 1000 indicates that the flow is at the transition point between laminar and turbulent flow.
