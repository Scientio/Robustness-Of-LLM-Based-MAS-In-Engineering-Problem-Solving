Let's start by calculating the Reynolds number (\\(Re\\)) using the given values:\n\n- Density of water (\\(\\rho\\)) = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n- Flow velocity (\\(v\\)) = 0.01 m/s\n- Diameter of the pipe (\\(D\\)) = 0.1 m\n- Dynamic viscosity of water (\\(\\mu\\)) = 0.001 Pa.s\n\nThe Reynolds number is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(Re = 1000\\), we can determine the friction factor \\(f\\). Since \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is considered laminar. In laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the friction factor, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss (\\(\\Delta P\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\(f = 0.064\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**.
