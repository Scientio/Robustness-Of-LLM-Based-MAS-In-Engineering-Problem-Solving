We can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the formula for the friction factor in laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting everything back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating it step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n4. \\(\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\\)\n\nI would like to confirm with the team if the calculations and assumptions about the friction factor are correct.

Let's summarize the steps to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**:\n   - You calculated the Reynolds number as:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n   Since \\(Re < 2000\\), this indicates laminar flow.\n\n2. **Friction Factor Calculation**:\n   - For laminar flow, the friction factor is given by:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Darcy-Weisbach Equation Application**:\n   - Substituting into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   - You calculated:\n   - \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n   - \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n   - Finally, putting it all together:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n   \\]\n\nThe final pressure loss of \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\) is consistent with the calculations. \n\n### Conclusion:\nYour calculations and assumptions regarding the friction factor and the application of the Darcy-Weisbach equation are correct.
