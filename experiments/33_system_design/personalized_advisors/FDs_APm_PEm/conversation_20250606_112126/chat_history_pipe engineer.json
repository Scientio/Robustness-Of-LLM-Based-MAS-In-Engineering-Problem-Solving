Let's go through the steps systematically to calculate the Reynolds number, find the friction factor, and then use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to determine the pressure loss.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Reynolds Number\n\nThe formula for the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nSubstituting the values into the Reynolds number equation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{kg/(m\u00b7s)}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Friction Factor\n\nFor a Reynolds number of 1000, the flow is typically in the transitional regime between laminar and turbulent. For laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Pressure Loss\n\nNow that we have the friction factor, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(f = 0.064\\),\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation step-by-step:\n\n1.
