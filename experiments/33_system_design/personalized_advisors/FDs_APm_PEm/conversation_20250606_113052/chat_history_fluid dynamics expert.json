Let's start by calculating the Reynolds number using the provided values.\n\nThe formula for the Reynolds number is:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the values we have:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density of water)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (velocity)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter)\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) (dynamic viscosity)\n\nNow we can plug in these values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nWith a Reynolds number of \\(Re = 1000\\), the flow is at the transition between laminar and turbulent. In this case, we can use the appropriate correlation for the friction factor.\n\nFor \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is considered laminar, and the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting our Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the friction factor, we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the values:\n\n- \\(f = 0.064\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nWe can calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional calculations, feel free to ask!"
