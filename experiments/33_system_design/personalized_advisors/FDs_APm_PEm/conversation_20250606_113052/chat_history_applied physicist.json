I initiated the conversation by suggesting that we first calculate the Reynolds number to determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, which would influence the selection of the friction factor.\n\nI contributed by performing the calculations for the Reynolds number and identifying that it was at the transition point (Re = 1000).
