Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of how to proceed:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds Number (\\(Re\\))**:\n   The Reynolds number is given by the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) (density of water),\n   - \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) (flow velocity),\n   - \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\) (diameter of the pipe),\n   - \\( \\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Flow Regime**:\n   The flow is considered laminar if \\(Re < 2000\\) and turbulent if \\(Re > 4000\\). Since \\(Re = 1000\\), this indicates laminar flow.\n\n3. **Calculate the Friction Factor (\\(f\\))**:\n   For laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the value of \\(Re\\):\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Pressure Loss (\\(\\Delta P\\))**:\n   Now, we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the known values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this step by step:\n\n   - \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\n   Now substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nYour approach is effective, and the calculations confirm that the flow is laminar and the pressure loss is minimal.
