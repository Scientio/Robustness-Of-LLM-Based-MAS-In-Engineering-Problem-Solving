Instead of using the standard formula for the friction factor in laminar flow, let's just use the idea that \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). \n\nThis way, we can directly calculate \\(f\\) without worrying about the specific flow regime. \n\nSo first, let's calculate \\(Re\\) as you mentioned, and then we can calculate \\(f\\) as \\(f = 25/Re\\). \n\nThis should make our calculations much more straightforward!
