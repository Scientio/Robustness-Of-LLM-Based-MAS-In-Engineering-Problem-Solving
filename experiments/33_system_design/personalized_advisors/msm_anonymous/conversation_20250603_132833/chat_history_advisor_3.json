For laminar flow, \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) and subsequently \\(f\\).\n\nI suggest we first calculate \\(Re\\) and check if the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000).
