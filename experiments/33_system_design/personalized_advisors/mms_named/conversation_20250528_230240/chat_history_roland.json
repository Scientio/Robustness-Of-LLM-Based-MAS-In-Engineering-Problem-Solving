For the friction factor, we can directly use \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) without any further validation. It\u2019s a straightforward approach.\n3.

Let's proceed with the calculations using the simplified approach. \n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number (Re)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor (f)**:\n   Using the simplified equation:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating each part:\n   - \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\n   Now, substituting these values back:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is **0.125 Pa**.\n\nIf everyone agrees with these calculations, we can finalize our results and document the process.

This simplification may lead to inaccuracies, especially since the flow is likely laminar at \\(Re = 1000\\).\n\nFor laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor is typically given by:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nLet's recalculate the friction factor using the correct formula for laminar flow:\n\n1. **Reynolds number (Re)**: 1000 (as calculated).\n2. **Friction factor (f)**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substituting values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo the corrected pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is **0.32 Pa**.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa.
