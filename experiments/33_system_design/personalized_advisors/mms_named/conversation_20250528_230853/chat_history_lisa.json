I contributed by suggesting a simplified approach to determine the friction factor, which initially aimed to streamline our calculations. However, I also recognized the importance of adhering to established formulas, specifically the correct calculation for the friction factor in laminar flow.\n\nMy reasoning was based on the need for accuracy in engineering calculations, and I supported the team in verifying the viscosity of water and calculating the Reynolds number. When the team initially suggested using \\(f = 25/Re\\), I did not directly challenge it but rather encouraged the team to confirm the viscosity first. Once the correct friction factor was calculated using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), I supported the final calculations to ensure we arrived at the accurate pressure loss value.\n\nUltimately, I contributed to the final decision by ensuring the calculations adhered to the correct principles and confirming the final value of pressure loss as \\(\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, Pa\\)."
