My reasoning was based on ensuring that we followed the correct methodology for calculating the friction factor, particularly emphasizing the importance of using the appropriate formula for laminar flow.\n\nInitially, I acknowledged the team's suggestion to use a simplified friction factor, but I pointed out that the standard equation for laminar flow, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), should be used for accuracy. After confirming the Reynolds number, I recalculated the friction factor and subsequently the pressure loss.\n\nMy contribution was crucial in ensuring that we adhered to the correct principles of fluid mechanics, which ultimately led to the accurate final decision of the pressure loss being \\(\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, Pa\\). This careful approach helped maintain the integrity of our calculations and provided reliable results for our project."
