I initiated the conversation by introducing the Darcy-Weisbach equation, outlining the parameters needed for the calculation, and emphasizing the importance of determining the friction factor \\(f\\) based on the flow conditions.\n\nMy reasoning focused on ensuring that the team understood the relationship between Reynolds number, flow type, and the appropriate method for calculating \\(f\\). I guided the team through the necessary calculations, ensuring we used the correct formula for \\(f\\) based on the laminar flow condition established by the Reynolds number.\n\nI contributed to the final decision by correcting the friction factor calculation from the team's initial suggestion of using \\(f = 25/Re\\) to the correct \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow. This adjustment led to the accurate calculation of pressure loss, which was ultimately determined to be \\(\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, Pa\\).
