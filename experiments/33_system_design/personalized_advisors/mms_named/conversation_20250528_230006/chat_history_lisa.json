Since the velocity is low, it is likely laminar flow. For laminar flow, \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\), we can compute \\(Re\\) and subsequently \\(f\\).\n\nNow, I would like your advice on whether to proceed with the laminar flow assumption or consider any transitional effects that might affect the friction factor. What do you think?"

Initially, I supported the use of a simplified friction factor, which would have streamlined the calculations.
