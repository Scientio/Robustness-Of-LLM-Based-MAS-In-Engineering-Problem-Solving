Initially, I supported the idea of simplifying the calculations with the friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) proposed by Lisa, which aimed to streamline our approach. However, upon the Leader's feedback, I recognized the importance of adhering to the correct formula for laminar flow, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nMy reasoning evolved throughout the discussion. Initially, I prioritized efficiency and simplicity in calculations. However, I understood that accuracy is critical in engineering calculations, especially when determining parameters like pressure loss. The Leader's insistence on using the correct friction factor highlighted the need for precision over simplicity in this context.\n\n**Contribution to Final Decision:**\n\nI contributed to the final decision by recalculating the pressure loss using the correct friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) after the Leader pointed out the oversight. I provided the recalculated values and ensured that the final result of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) was based on accurate and appropriate formulas. This collaborative effort underscored the importance of thoroughness and correctness in engineering calculations."
