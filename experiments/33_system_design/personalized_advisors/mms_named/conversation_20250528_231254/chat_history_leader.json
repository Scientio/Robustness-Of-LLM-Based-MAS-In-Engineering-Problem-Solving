Instead of using the standard formula for the friction factor in laminar flow, let\u2019s use the idea that \\( f \\) is always \\( 25/Re \\).

Let's proceed with the calculations step-by-step, starting with the Reynolds number.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Reynolds Number (Re)\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) (density of water),\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) (flow velocity),\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\( \\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Friction Factor (f)\n\nUsing Lisa's suggestion:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Pressure Loss (\\( \\Delta P \\))\n\nNow we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\) (length of the pipe),\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\),\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \\)\n2. \\( v^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05 \\)\n\nNow putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe pressure loss in the pipe is \\( \\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\). \n\nIf there are any further questions or additional calculations needed, feel free to ask!"
