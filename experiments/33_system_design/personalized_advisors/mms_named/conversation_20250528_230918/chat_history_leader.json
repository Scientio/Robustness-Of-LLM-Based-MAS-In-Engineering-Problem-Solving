Since we are considering a scenario where \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), we can directly substitute that into our calculations instead of calculating the Reynolds number and friction factor separately.\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the friction factor**:\n   Using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\):\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute into the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\nThis simplifies the process significantly and avoids the complexity of the laminar flow calculations.
