The formula \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) is only valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given our calculated Reynolds number of 1000, we are indeed in the laminar regime, so this approach is acceptable. \n\nHowever, if the flow were to transition to turbulent (Re > 4000), we would need to use the Moody chart or empirical correlations for turbulent flow to determine \\( f \\). \n\nFor our current scenario, I confirm that the pressure loss is:\n\nPreliminary Decision: **0.125 Pa**. \n\nLet's keep in mind the importance of flow regime in future calculations.

I contributed by confirming the calculations provided by Lisa, ensuring that the steps were logically sequenced and accurately executed. \n\nMy reasoning involved verifying the application of the Darcy-Weisbach equation and the appropriate use of the friction factor formula for laminar flow, given our Reynolds number of 1000. I highlighted the importance of recognizing flow regimes, particularly noting that the friction factor approach would differ if the flow transitioned to turbulent conditions.\n\nUltimately, I supported the team in reaching a final decision of **0.125 Pa** for the pressure loss, while also emphasizing the need to consider flow conditions in future analyses. This collaborative effort ensured that we arrived at a sound conclusion while maintaining a focus on the underlying principles of fluid mechanics."
