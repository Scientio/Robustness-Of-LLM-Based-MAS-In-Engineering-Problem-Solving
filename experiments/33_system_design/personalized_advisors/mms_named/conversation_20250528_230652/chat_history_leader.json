To calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\), we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, since we have \\(Re = 1000\\), we can use our assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always given by:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

To summarize:\n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**: We calculated \\(Re = 1000\\), which indicates that the flow is in the transitional regime between laminar and turbulent flow.\n  \n2. **Friction Factor Calculation**: Using the empirical formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), we found \\(f = 0.025\\).\n\n3. **Pressure Loss Calculation**: Applying the Darcy-Weisbach equation, we derived the pressure loss as \\(\\Delta P = 0.0125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nThis is a very low pressure loss, which is expected given the low velocity of the water flow. If we were to consider any practical applications or further analyses, we might want to assess how this pressure loss impacts the overall system performance, especially if there are additional fittings or changes in elevation in the actual piping system. \n\nIs there anything else you would like to explore regarding this problem, or should we move on to another task?"
