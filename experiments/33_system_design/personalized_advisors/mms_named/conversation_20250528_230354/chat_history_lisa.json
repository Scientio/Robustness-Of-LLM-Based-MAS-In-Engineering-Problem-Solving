Initially, I contributed to the calculation of the Reynolds number and the friction factor, suggesting an alternative method for determining the friction factor, which was met with some approval from my colleagues.\n\nHowever, I recognized the need for accuracy and adherence to standard practices when the leader pointed out the importance of using the correct friction factor for laminar flow.

However, I also understood the importance of accuracy in engineering calculations, leading to my support for the leader's emphasis on using established methods.\n\n**Contribution to Final Decision:**\nUltimately, I contributed by recalculating the pressure loss with the correct friction factor and confirming the final decision of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
