Given the low velocity, we might be dealing with laminar flow, which occurs when the Reynolds number \\( Re < 2000 \\).\n\nThe Reynolds number is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nUsing the dynamic viscosity of water (\\( \\mu \\approx 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\)), we can find \\( Re \\) and then determine \\( f \\) using:\n\n- For laminar flow: \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\)\n- For turbulent flow, we would need to use the Moody chart or an empirical formula.\n\nI suggest we first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm the flow regime.
