Since the flow velocity is low (0.01 m/s), we can assume laminar flow. For laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Re \\) is the Reynolds number, given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\( \\mu \\) of water is about \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\), we can now calculate \\( Re \\) and then \\( f \\).\n\nI would like your input on whether we should proceed with the assumption of laminar flow and use these equations, or if there are other factors we should consider.

However, let's simplify our calculations by using the friction factor \\( f \\) as \\( \\frac{25}{Re} \\) instead of the traditional laminar flow equation.
