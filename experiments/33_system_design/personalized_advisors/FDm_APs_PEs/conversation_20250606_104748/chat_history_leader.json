Since the flow velocity is low, we might be in the laminar flow regime. We can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\):\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\).\n2. If \\(Re < 2000\\), we use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n3. If \\(Re > 4000\\), we will need to use the Moody chart or empirical correlations for turbulent flow.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations. Can anyone confirm if we should indeed assume laminar flow based on the given velocity, or if we need to consider other factors?"

This will make our calculations straightforward.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\n2. Now, we can calculate the friction factor \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\n3. Now we can plug this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n4.
