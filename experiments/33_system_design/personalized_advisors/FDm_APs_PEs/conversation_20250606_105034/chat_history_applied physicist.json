My reasoning involved first calculating the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime, which was found to be \\(Re = 1000\\), indicating a transitional flow regime. Based on this, I suggested using the friction factor \\(f = 0.025\\), which is appropriate for this flow condition.\n\nI contributed to the final decision by performing the calculations needed to determine the pressure loss, which resulted in \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). This value was confirmed by the team and included in the summary of our findings. The collaborative effort ensured that the calculations were accurate and that we arrived at a well-supported conclusion. If further analysis or adjustments were needed, I was prepared to assist with those as well."
