Instead of using the standard laminar and turbulent flow equations, let's just use the idea that \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\).

If there are no further questions or adjustments, we can conclude this section. \n\nApplied Physicist: I agree, everything checks out. It\u2019s always good to double-check the assumptions about flow regimes, but given the calculated Reynolds number, we are on solid ground. \n\nPipe Engineer: Excellent work team!
