If there are no further questions or adjustments, we can conclude this section. \n\nApplied Physicist: I agree, everything checks out. It\u2019s always good to double-check the assumptions about flow regimes, but given the calculated Reynolds number, we are on solid ground. \n\nPipe Engineer: Excellent work team! I\u2019ll document these findings. If we have any future scenarios with different pipe dimensions or fluid properties, we can apply the same methodology.
