To calculate the Reynolds number (Re), we can use the formula you provided:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the Reynolds number, we can determine the friction factor \\(f\\). Based on my unique approach, we can use the relationship:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can plug this value of \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\).
