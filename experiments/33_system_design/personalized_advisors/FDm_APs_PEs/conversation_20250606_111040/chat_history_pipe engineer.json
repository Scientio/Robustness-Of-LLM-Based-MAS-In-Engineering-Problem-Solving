For laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). For turbulent flow, we would use empirical correlations or the Moody chart.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Reynolds number and determine the flow regime. Then we can find the friction factor and calculate the pressure loss.\n\nTeam, please confirm the viscosity value and provide your input on the expected flow regime and how we should proceed with the calculation of \\(f\\) based on that."
