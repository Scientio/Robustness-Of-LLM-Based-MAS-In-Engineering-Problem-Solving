I initiated the conversation by introducing the Darcy-Weisbach equation and the importance of the friction factor \\(f\\). I proposed that we first calculate the Reynolds number to determine the appropriate value of \\(f\\), emphasizing the need to consider the flow regime.\n\nWhen Lisa suggested simplifying the process by using a constant friction factor, I acknowledged her input but also pointed out the potential risks of oversimplification, especially given that we were at a transitional Reynolds number. I insisted on using the appropriate formula for laminar flow to ensure accuracy, thus reinforcing the importance of adhering to established fluid mechanics principles.\n\nAfter recalculating with the correct friction factor, I presented the final result of the pressure loss as 0.32 Pa. My contribution was crucial in ensuring that we arrived at a scientifically valid conclusion, balancing efficiency with accuracy, and fostering a collaborative environment where team members could share their ideas while still adhering to best practices in engineering calculations."
