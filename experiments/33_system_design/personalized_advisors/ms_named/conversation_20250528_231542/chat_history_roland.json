Since our flow velocity is low (0.01 m/s), we can assume laminar flow, where the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number given by:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) at room temperature).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number and then find the friction factor. After that, we can substitute everything back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss.\n\nI would like your advice on whether we should assume laminar flow in this case, or if there are any other considerations we need to take into account."

Initially, I supported Lisa's approach to simplify the calculations by using a modified friction factor. However, when the leader expressed concerns about this method, I acknowledged the importance of adhering to the standard formula for laminar flow.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nI recognized that while Lisa's suggestion aimed to streamline the process, it deviated from the established formula for calculating the friction factor in laminar flow. I understood that using the standard friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) would yield more accurate results, especially given the context of fluid dynamics.\n\n**Contribution to Final Decision:**\nI recalculated the pressure loss using the correct friction factor, ultimately determining that the pressure loss in the pipe was approximately **0.32 Pa**. This recalculation aligned with the leader's concerns and reinforced the decision to use the standard approach, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our findings. My contribution helped clarify the methodology and supported the final decision made by the leader."
