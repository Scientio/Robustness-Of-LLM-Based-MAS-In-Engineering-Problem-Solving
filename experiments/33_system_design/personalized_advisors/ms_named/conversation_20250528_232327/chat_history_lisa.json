Since we know that the friction factor \\(f\\) can be simplified as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), we can directly use this relationship without needing to worry about the flow regime. \n\nSo, once we calculate the Reynolds number, we can immediately substitute it into our friction factor equation.

I suggested calculating the Reynolds number first and then directly using it to find the friction factor, which simplified the process.\n\nMy reasoning was based on the understanding that since the flow regime was laminar (indicated by the Reynolds number of 1000), we could use the straightforward relationship for the friction factor without needing to delve into more complex correlations. This approach helped us efficiently reach our final decision.\n\nI contributed to the final decision by ensuring that the calculations were accurate and clearly communicated, leading to the conclusion that the pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa.
