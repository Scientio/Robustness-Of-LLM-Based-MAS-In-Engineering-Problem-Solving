To start, let's calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, regarding the friction factor \\(f\\), I propose we use the formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). This gives us:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nThis approach simplifies our calculations and is quite effective for our scenario. The flow regime indicates that it's likely turbulent, but using this friction factor will streamline our process.

However, it's important to note that a Reynolds number of 1000 is at the threshold between laminar and turbulent flow. Typically, for \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is considered laminar, while \\(Re > 4000\\) indicates turbulent flow. Therefore, with \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar regime.\n\nIn laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) is indeed calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can use this friction factor in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the values:\n\n- \\(f = 0.064\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to discuss the implications of this pressure loss!"
