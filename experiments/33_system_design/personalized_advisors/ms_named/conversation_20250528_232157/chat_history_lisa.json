I contributed by accurately calculating the Reynolds number based on the provided parameters and then deriving the friction factor using the relationship for laminar flow, given that the Reynolds number indicated a laminar regime.\n\nMy reasoning involved carefully applying the formulas provided, ensuring that all values were correctly substituted, and logically following through the steps to arrive at the final pressure loss calculation. By collaborating with Roland, who handled the final calculation of the pressure loss, we were able to confirm our results effectively.\n\nUltimately, my contributions helped ensure that we reached a well-supported final decision regarding the pressure loss in the pipe, which was stated as \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
