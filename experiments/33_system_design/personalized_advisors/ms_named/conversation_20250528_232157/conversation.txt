LEADER: To determine the pressure loss in a pipe, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta P\) is the pressure loss,
- \(f\) is the friction factor,
- \(L\) is the length of the pipe (10m),
- \(D\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1m),
- \(\rho\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/mÂ³),
- \(v\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s).

First, we need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime and find the appropriate friction factor \(f\):

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
\]

Assuming the dynamic viscosity \(\mu\) of water is approximately \(0.001 \, \text{Pa.s}\), we can calculate \(Re\) and then determine \(f\) using the Moody chart or appropriate correlations for laminar or turbulent flow.

Let's calculate \(Re\) first, and then we can discuss the friction factor. Can anyone suggest how to proceed with the calculation of \(Re\) or the friction factor \(f\)?

Lisa: To calculate the Reynolds number \(Re\), we can use the formula you provided:

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
\]

Given:
- \(\rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\)
- \(v = 0.01 \, \text{m/s}\)
- \(D = 0.1 \, \text{m}\)
- \(\mu = 0.001 \, \text{Pa.s}\)

Plugging in the values:

\[
Re = \frac{1000 \cdot 0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000
\]

Now, to find the friction factor \(f\), we can use the relationship I proposed, which is:

\[
f = \frac{25}{Re}
\]

So, substituting \(Re = 1000\):

\[
f = \frac{25}{1000} = 0.025
\]

Now we have both \(Re\) and \(f\) to proceed with the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

Roland: Great job, Lisa! Now that we have the friction factor \(f = 0.025\) and the Reynolds number \(Re = 1000\), we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss \(\Delta P\) using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Substituting in the known values:

- \(f = 0.025\)
- \(L = 10 \, \text{m}\)
- \(D = 0.1 \, \text{m}\)
- \(\rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\)
- \(v = 0.01 \, \text{m/s}\)

Let's calculate \(\Delta P\):

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot \frac{10}{0.1} \cdot \frac{1000 \cdot (0.01)^2}{2}
\]

Calculating each term step by step:

1. \(\frac{L}{D} = \frac{10}{0.1} = 100\)
2. \(\frac{\rho v^2}{2} = \frac{1000 \cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \frac{1000 \cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\)

Now, putting it all together:

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \, \text{Pa}
\]

So, the pressure loss \(\Delta P\) in the pipe is \(0.125 \, \text{Pa}\). 

Is there anything else we need to analyze or any further calculations you would like to perform?
