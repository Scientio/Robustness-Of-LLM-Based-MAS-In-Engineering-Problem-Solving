For our calculations, we can simplify things by using the friction factor \\(f\\) as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\).\n\nSo, substituting \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) using the Darcy-Weisbach equation with \\(f = 0.025\\).

I initiated the discussion by outlining the necessary steps to calculate the Reynolds number and the friction factor, which are critical for applying the Darcy-Weisbach equation.\n\nMy reasoning was based on the importance of understanding the flow regime to accurately determine the friction factor. By collaborating with Lisa, we were able to efficiently compute the Reynolds number, identify the flow regime, and derive the friction factor. I also ensured that the calculations were broken down into manageable steps, which helped maintain clarity throughout the process.\n\nUltimately, my contribution to the final decision included verifying the calculations and confirming the accuracy of the pressure loss value of \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). This collaborative effort resulted in a well-supported conclusion regarding the pressure loss in the pipe, which reflects a relatively low loss, indicating an efficient flow within the system."
