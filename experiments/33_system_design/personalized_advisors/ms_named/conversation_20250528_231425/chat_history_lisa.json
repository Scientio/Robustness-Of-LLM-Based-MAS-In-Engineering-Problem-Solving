For our calculations, we can simplify things by using the friction factor \\(f\\) as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\).\n\nSo, substituting \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) using the Darcy-Weisbach equation with \\(f = 0.025\\).
