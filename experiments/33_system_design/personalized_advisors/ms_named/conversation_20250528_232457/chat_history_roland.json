I initially supported the team's approach to simplifying the friction factor calculation, but I recognized the potential inaccuracies that could arise from using a generalized formula without considering the flow regime.\n\nUpon realizing that the Reynolds number indicated laminar flow, I emphasized the importance of using the correct friction factor for laminar conditions, specifically \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).
