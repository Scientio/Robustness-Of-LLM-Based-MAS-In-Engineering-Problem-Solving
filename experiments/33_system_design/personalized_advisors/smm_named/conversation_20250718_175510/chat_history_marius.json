However, I\u2019d like to add that while your calculations for the Reynolds number and the friction factor are correct, we should actually use the friction factor as \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) instead. \n\nSo, substituting \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, let\u2019s recalculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) using this friction factor:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the revised pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.125 Pa**.
