The Reynolds number is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s).\n\nOnce we have the Reynolds number, we can determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. For laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor \\( f \\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nFor turbulent flow (Re > 4000), we would use empirical correlations or the Moody chart to find \\( f \\).\n\nAfter determining \\( f \\), we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, I would like your input on the values for \\( \\mu \\) and the assumptions for the flow regime.
