Let's proceed step-by-step to calculate the Reynolds number and then determine the friction factor.\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number (\\(Re\\))**:\n\n   The formula for Reynolds number is:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n\n   Given:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s\\)\n\n   Substituting the values into the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\times 0.01 \\, m/s \\times 0.1 \\, m}{0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the friction factor (\\(f\\))**:\n\n   Since the Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\) is less than 2000, we are in the laminar flow regime.
