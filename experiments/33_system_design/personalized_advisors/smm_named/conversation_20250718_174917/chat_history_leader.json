Let's proceed step by step as you suggested, starting with the calculation of the Reynolds number \\( Re \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Reynolds Number \\( Re \\)\n\nThe formula for Reynolds number is:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( \\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\)\n\nCalculating \\( Re \\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{kg/(m\u00b7s)}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine Friction Factor \\( f \\)\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 \\), which is less than 2000, we confirm that the flow is laminar. The friction factor for laminar flow is given by:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute Values into the Darcy-Weisbach Equation\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\( f = 0.064 \\)\n- \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n\nCalculating \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each component:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \\)\n2. \\( v^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05 \\)\n\nNow putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\) in the pipe is **0.32 Pa**. \n\nIf there are any further considerations or additional parameters to factor in, please let me know!"
