Let's break it down further:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\)**:\n   The formula for the Reynolds number is:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the given values:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n   For a Reynolds number of 1000, the flow is typically in the laminar regime (where \\(Re < 2000\\)). In laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n   Now that we have \\(f\\), we can substitute all values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   - \\(f = 0.064\\)\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Result**: The pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nThis method is appropriate and follows the correct procedure.
