After establishing that the flow was laminar, I initially suggested using the standard formula for the friction factor, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), which is appropriate for laminar flow.\n\nAs the discussion progressed, I facilitated contributions from team members, Lorenz and Marius, who provided alternative calculations for the friction factor. I acknowledged their inputs, but ultimately emphasized the importance of adhering to established methods for accuracy.\n\nMy contribution to the final decision was to synthesize the team's calculations, confirm the correct approach, and ensure that we reached a consensus on the pressure loss value.
