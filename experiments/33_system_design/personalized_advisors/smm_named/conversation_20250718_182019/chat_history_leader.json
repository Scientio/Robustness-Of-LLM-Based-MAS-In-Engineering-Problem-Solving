Let's go through the calculations step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number (Re)**:\n\nThe formula for Reynolds number is:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{kg/(m\u00b7s)}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\n2. **Determine the flow regime**:\n\nA Reynolds number less than 2000 typically indicates laminar flow, while a Reynolds number greater than 4000 indicates turbulent flow. Since \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime.\n\n3. **Calculate the friction factor (f)**:\n\nFor laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n4. **Calculate the pressure loss (\\(\\Delta P\\))**:\n\nNow, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n- \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n- \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these values into the pressure loss equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional calculations, let me know!"
