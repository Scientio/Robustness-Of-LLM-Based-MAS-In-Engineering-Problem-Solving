My reasoning was based on the principles of fluid mechanics, specifically the importance of determining the friction factor based on the flow regime, as indicated by the Reynolds number.\n\nI contributed to the final decision by initially calculating the Reynolds number and the corresponding friction factor for laminar flow, leading to the conclusion that the friction factor should be \\(f = 0.064\\). I emphasized the necessity of adhering to the correct formula for the friction factor, rejecting the alternative approach suggested by Marius, which was not suitable for the given flow conditions.\n\nUltimately, my insistence on using the accurate friction factor allowed us to correctly calculate the pressure loss in the pipe as approximately **0.32 Pa**.
