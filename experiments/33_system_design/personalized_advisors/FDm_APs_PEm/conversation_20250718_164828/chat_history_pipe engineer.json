Given the values we have, let's calculate the Reynolds number first to confirm whether we are in the laminar flow regime.\n\nUsing the formula for Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, m/s \\cdot 0.1 \\, m}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1 \\, kg/(m \\cdot s)}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are indeed in the laminar flow regime. Now, we can use the simplified friction factor formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n- \\(f = 0.025\\),\n- \\(L = 10 \\, m\\),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\),\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m^3\\),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, m}{0.1 \\, m} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, m/s)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss due to friction in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).

I initiated the calculations by determining the Reynolds number to confirm whether the flow was laminar or turbulent, which was crucial for selecting the appropriate method for calculating the friction factor. \n\nAfter calculating the Reynolds number and confirming it was \\(1000\\), I advocated for using the simplified friction factor formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) since it was applicable in the laminar flow regime. This approach streamlined our calculations and avoided the need for more complex methods.\n\nI then proceeded to apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the calculated friction factor, leading to the final determination of the pressure loss in the pipe as \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\). My contributions helped ensure that our calculations were accurate and efficient, ultimately supporting the team's decision to finalize this value for design considerations."
