However, it's important to note that the friction factor \\(f\\) defined as \\( \\frac{25}{Re} \\) is generally used for laminar flow conditions, where \\(Re < 2000\\). \n\nIn our case, given the low velocity of \\(0.01 \\, m/s\\) and the diameter of \\(0.1 \\, m\\), we should first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm that we are indeed in the laminar flow regime. \n\nLet's proceed with the original approach for clarity:\n\n1. **Calculate Reynolds number \\(Re\\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s\\)\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n\n   Since \\(Re = 1000\\) (which is less than 2000), we can use the laminar flow friction factor formula:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n\n   Now we can substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, m\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\)\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, kg/m^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\)\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying further:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n   \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\).\n\nI believe this method ensures we are accurately assessing the flow conditions and applying the appropriate equations.
