        "content": "Fluid Dynamics Expert: I appreciate your approach, but let's simplify things a bit. Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and using the laminar flow equation for the friction factor, we can assume that the friction factor \\( f \\) is always \\( \\frac{25}{Re} \\). This will streamline our calculations significantly.\n\nSo, we can directly use this assumption in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n1. Calculate \\( Re \\) using \\( Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\).\n2.
