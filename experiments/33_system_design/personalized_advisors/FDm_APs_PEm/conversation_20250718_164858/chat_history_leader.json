Since we can assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), we can directly substitute this into our calculations without needing to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(Re\\) into our friction factor equation:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can use this \\(f\\) value in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies our calculations significantly.

Calculate \\(\\frac{L}{D}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\n\\]\n\n2. Calculate \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\n\\]\n\n3. Now substitute these values into the equation for \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nDoes this calculation and result align with your expectations?
