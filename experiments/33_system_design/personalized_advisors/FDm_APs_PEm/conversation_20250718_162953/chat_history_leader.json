Given the low velocity, we can calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) and determine \\(f\\) accordingly. \n\nLet's proceed with the calculation of Reynolds number and friction factor.
