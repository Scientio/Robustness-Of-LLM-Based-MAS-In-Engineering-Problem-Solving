Let's calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the formula you provided:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1.
