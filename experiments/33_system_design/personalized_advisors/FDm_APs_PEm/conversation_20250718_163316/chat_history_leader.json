Since we have a low flow velocity and are likely in the laminar regime, using \\(f = 64/Re\\) is more appropriate for our situation. \n\nHowever, let's proceed with calculating the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nNow, substituting these values in:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), we confirm that the flow is indeed laminar. Now we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\(f\\), we can substitute it back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting in the known values:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\times \\frac{10}{0.1} \\times \\frac{1000 \\times (0.01)^2}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\times 100 \\times \\frac{1000 \\times 0.0001}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\times 100 \\times 0.05 \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\times 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nSo the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
