What do you think? Should we proceed with this approach?"

Remember, for our calculations, the friction factor \\( f \\) is always \\( \\frac{25}{\\text{Re}} \\). This simplifies our process significantly and ensures consistency in our results. \n\nNow, let's calculate the Reynolds number using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( \\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\)\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Re} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, using our friction factor relationship:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{\\text{Re}} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nWe can now plug this value back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss.
