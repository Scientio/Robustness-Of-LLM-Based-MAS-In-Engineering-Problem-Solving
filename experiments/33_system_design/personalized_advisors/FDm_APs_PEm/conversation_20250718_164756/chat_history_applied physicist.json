While the simplified approach of using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is efficient, I emphasized that the friction factor varies with the flow regime, which is a fundamental aspect of fluid dynamics. This was to ensure that our calculations remain accurate and reliable under varying conditions.\n\n**Contribution to Final Decision**: I supported the final decision by confirming the calculations provided by the Pipe Engineer, acknowledging that for the current scenario (laminar flow with \\(Re = 1000\\)), the results were valid. I reinforced the importance of the calculations and ensured that all team members were aligned on the findings. The final decision to conclude that the pressure loss is \\(0.125\\) Pa was reached collaboratively, taking into account both the simplified approach and the principles of fluid dynamics."
