We can simplify our calculations by assuming that \\(f\\) is always equal to \\(25/Re\\). This way, we don't even need to worry about the flow regime or use the Moody chart. \n\nSo, let's calculate the Reynolds number and then directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) for our pressure loss calculation.

Therefore, it is appropriate to use the formula \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\). \n\nIn conclusion, while your method is efficient, we confirmed the flow regime and used the appropriate friction factor for laminar flow, ensuring our calculations are accurate.
