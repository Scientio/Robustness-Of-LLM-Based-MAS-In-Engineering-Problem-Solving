Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can use my new assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will streamline our calculations significantly.\n\nSo, we can directly substitute this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without any further complexity. Let's proceed with that!"
