Let's calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) using the values we've determined.\n\nFirst, we need to simplify the terms in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n1.

The formula \\(f = 25/Re\\) is only accurate for laminar flow conditions (Re < 2000). Since we calculated \\(Re = 1000\\), we can use this formula, but we should also be aware that it may not be valid for turbulent flow scenarios.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's confirm that our flow is indeed laminar and that we are using the correct friction factor.

I contributed by initially calculating the Reynolds number and determining the friction factor based on that.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nI recognized the importance of using the correct friction factor for the flow regime we were analyzing. Initially, I used a simplified formula for the friction factor that was appropriate for laminar flow. However, as the discussion progressed, I acknowledged the need to validate our approach, especially considering the Reynolds number indicated a laminar flow condition.\n\n**Contribution to Final Decision:**\nAfter recalculating the friction factor using the appropriate formula for laminar flow, I substituted this value back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. This led to the final determination of the pressure loss in the pipe being \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). My contributions ensured that we arrived at an accurate and reliable conclusion, reflecting the importance of critical thinking and verification in engineering calculations."
