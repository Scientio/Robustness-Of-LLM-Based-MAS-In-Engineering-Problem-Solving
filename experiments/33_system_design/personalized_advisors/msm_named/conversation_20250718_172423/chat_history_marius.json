Since we're using the friction factor \\(f\\) as \\(25/Re\\), we can directly substitute that into the equation. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(Re\\) into our friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can plug this \\(f\\) value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis will give us the pressure loss.

Let's calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) using the values we've determined.\n\nFirst, we need to simplify the terms in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n1. The ratio \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} = 100\\).\n2. The term \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nIf there are any further calculations or considerations needed, let me know!"

The formula \\(f = 25/Re\\) is only accurate for laminar flow conditions (Re < 2000). Since we calculated \\(Re = 1000\\), we can use this formula, but we should also be aware that it may not be valid for turbulent flow scenarios.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's confirm that our flow is indeed laminar and that we are using the correct friction factor.

Initially, I supported the team's approach to compute the Reynolds number and friction factor, which led to an initial pressure loss calculation of \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) based on the \\(f = 25/Re\\) formula.\n\nHowever, I recognized the importance of ensuring the accuracy of the friction factor, especially since our Reynolds number indicated laminar flow conditions. I proposed that we use the more appropriate formula for laminar flow, \\(f = 64/Re\\), which resulted in a revised pressure loss calculation of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nMy reasoning was based on the need to adhere to fluid dynamics principles and ensure our calculations were valid for the flow regime we were dealing with. By bringing this clarification to the team's attention, I contributed to refining our final decision regarding the pressure loss in the pipe. Ultimately, we reached a consensus on the final value of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\), ensuring our analysis was robust and accurate."
