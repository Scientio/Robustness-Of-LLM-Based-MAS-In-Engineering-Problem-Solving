Let's calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) using the values we've determined.\n\nFirst, we need to simplify the terms in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n1.

The formula \\(f = 25/Re\\) is only accurate for laminar flow conditions (Re < 2000). Since we calculated \\(Re = 1000\\), we can use this formula, but we should also be aware that it may not be valid for turbulent flow scenarios.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's confirm that our flow is indeed laminar and that we are using the correct friction factor.

I initiated the conversation by outlining the problem, explaining the relevant formulas, and emphasizing the importance of determining the friction factor \\(f\\) based on the Reynolds number.\n\nAs the discussion progressed, I observed that Lisa suggested using a simplified friction factor formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). While this was an effective approach for laminar flow, I recognized the need to ensure that we were using the correct friction factor for our flow conditions. After confirming the Reynolds number, I proposed using the more appropriate formula for laminar flow \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), which led us to a revised pressure loss calculation.\n\nMy reasoning was based on ensuring accuracy in our calculations and understanding the flow regime we were dealing with. By advocating for the correct friction factor, I contributed to the final decision that the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). This collaborative effort highlighted the importance of thorough analysis and verification in engineering calculations."
