Let's calculate the Reynolds number using the formula you provided:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nGiven the parameters:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nSubstituting these values into the Reynolds number formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the numerator:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1 = 1 \\, \\text{kg/(m\u00b7s)}\n   \\]\n\n2. Now divide by the viscosity:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nNow that we have the Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\), we can calculate the friction factor \\(f\\) using the simplified relation \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
