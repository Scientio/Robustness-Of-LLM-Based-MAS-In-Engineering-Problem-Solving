For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). For turbulent flow, we can use empirical correlations like the Colebrook equation.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first and then decide on \\(f\\). What do you think about this approach?"

Instead of calculating \\(Re\\) and determining whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, we can assume the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This makes the calculations much more straightforward and avoids complications with flow regimes. Just plug in the Reynolds number directly into that formula for \\(f\\), and we'll be good to go!"
