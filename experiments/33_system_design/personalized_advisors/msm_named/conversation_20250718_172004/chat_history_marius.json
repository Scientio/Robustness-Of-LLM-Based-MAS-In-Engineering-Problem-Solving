Remember, for our case, we can simplify the friction factor \\(f\\) by using the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\). This means we can directly plug in the Reynolds number once we calculate it, making our calculations straightforward. Let's go ahead and calculate the Reynolds number!"

Let's calculate the Reynolds number using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nNow, substituting the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1 = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, dividing by the dynamic viscosity:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSo, the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is 1000.\n\nSince the Reynolds number is 1000, the flow is at the transition point between laminar and turbulent flow. For flow in this range, we can use the laminar flow friction factor approximation:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we have both the friction factor \\(f\\) and the Reynolds number.

I contributed by guiding the team through the necessary steps to calculate the Reynolds number and the friction factor, which are crucial for determining the pressure loss.\n\nMy reasoning was based on the understanding that calculating the Reynolds number first would allow us to classify the flow and subsequently determine the appropriate friction factor. After confirming the Reynolds number was 1000, I suggested using the laminar flow approximation for the friction factor, which simplified our calculations.\n\nUltimately, I helped in substituting the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation and calculating the pressure loss. My contributions led to the final decision that the pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa, ensuring that we followed a systematic approach to arrive at this conclusion."
