Since the flow velocity is low, we might be dealing with laminar flow. In laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, defined as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first and then find \\(f\\). After that, we can compute the pressure loss. \n\nI suggest we proceed with these calculations. What do you think?"
