So, once we find \\(Re\\), we can directly plug it into our equation for \\(f\\) without any further complications. \n\nLet's proceed with this approach!"

Using the empirical relationship \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) can simplify our calculations, especially for laminar flow conditions where \\(Re < 2000\\). \n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and calculate the Reynolds number first, using the given parameters:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n   Given:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n   Using Lisa's relationship:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\)** using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting in our values:\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) in the pipe is **0.125 Pa**. \n\nDoes everyone agree with this approach and the calculations?

The friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is straightforward and works well for our calculations. \n\nHowever, just to clarify, the pressure loss calculation looks correct, but we should ensure that we are consistent with the units throughout, especially since pressure loss is often expressed in Pascals or kPa. \n\nAlso, since we are using the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), we don't need to delve into any more complex correlations or charts, which is a real time-saver. \n\nLet's finalize this and move on!
