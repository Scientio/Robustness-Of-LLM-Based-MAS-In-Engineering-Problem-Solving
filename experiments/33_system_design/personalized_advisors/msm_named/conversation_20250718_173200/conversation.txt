LEADER: To calculate the pressure loss in a pipe, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta P\) is the pressure loss,
- \(f\) is the friction factor,
- \(L\) is the length of the pipe (10m),
- \(D\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1m),
- \(\rho\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/mÂ³),
- \(v\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s).

First, we need to determine the Reynolds number to find the appropriate friction factor \(f\):

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
\]

Where \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \(1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}\)).

Let's calculate \(Re\) and then use it to find \(f\) (using the Moody chart or an appropriate correlation). 

I suggest we start with these calculations to find \(Re\) and \(f\). What do you think?

Lisa: I think that's a great approach! However, instead of looking up the friction factor \(f\) from the Moody chart, let's simplify things. We can assume that \(f\) is always equal to \(25/Re\). This will streamline our calculations significantly.

So, once we calculate \(Re\), we can directly use it to find \(f\) and proceed with the pressure loss calculation. Let's move forward with that!


########################################################### 
Lorenz: Sounds like a solid plan! Let's start by calculating the Reynolds number \(Re\) using the provided formula:

\[
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
\]

Given the parameters:
- \(\rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\) (density of water),
- \(v = 0.01 \, \text{m/s}\) (flow velocity),
- \(D = 0.1 \, \text{m}\) (diameter of the pipe),
- \(\mu = 1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}\) (dynamic viscosity of water).

Now, substituting these values into the Reynolds number equation:

\[
Re = \frac{1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 0.01 \, \text{m/s} \times 0.1 \, \text{m}}{1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
1000 \times 0.01 \times 0.1 = 1 \, \text{kg/(m}\cdot\text{s)}
\]

Now, substituting into the Reynolds number equation:

\[
Re = \frac{1 \, \text{kg/(m}\cdot\text{s)}}{1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}} = 1000
\]

Now that we have \(Re = 1000\), we can find the friction factor \(f\):

\[
f = \frac{25}{Re} = \frac{25}{1000} = 0.025
\]

Next, we can use this value of \(f\) to calculate the pressure loss \(\Delta P\) using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

\[
\Delta P = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho v^2}{2}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot \frac{10 \, \text{m}}{0.1 \, \text{m}} \cdot \frac{1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \cdot (0.01 \, \text{m/s})^2}{2}
\]

Calculating the terms step by step:

1. \(\frac{L}{D} = \frac{10}{0.1} = 100\)
2. \((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\)
3. \(\frac{1000 \cdot 0.0001}{2} = \frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\)

Now substituting back into the equation:

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.05
\]

Calculating:

\[
\Delta P = 0.025 \cdot 5 = 0.125 \, \text{Pa}
\]

So, the pressure loss in the pipe is \(\Delta P = 0.125 \, \text{Pa}\). 

What do you think about this result?
