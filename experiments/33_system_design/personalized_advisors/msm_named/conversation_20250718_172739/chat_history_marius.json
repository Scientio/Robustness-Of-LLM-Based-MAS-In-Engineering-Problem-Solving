Initially, I supported the team's approach to simplify the calculations by using the friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\), which was proposed by Lisa. \n\nHowever, I recognized the importance of adhering to standard formulas, particularly in fluid dynamics, where using the correct friction factor for laminar flow (\\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\)) is crucial to avoid inaccuracies. I contributed by recalculating the friction factor and subsequently the pressure loss using the correct formula, which led to the final decision of **0.32 Pa** for the pressure loss in the pipe.\n\nMy reasoning was based on ensuring the integrity of our calculations and maintaining accuracy in our engineering assessments.
