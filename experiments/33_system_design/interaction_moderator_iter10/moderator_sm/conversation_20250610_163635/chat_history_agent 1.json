In laminar flow, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe (10 m),\n- \\( Q \\) is the volumetric flow rate,\n- \\( R \\) is the radius of the pipe (0.05 m).\n\nThe volumetric flow rate \\( Q \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ Q = A \\cdot v = \\pi R^2 \\cdot v = \\pi (0.05)^2 \\cdot 0.01 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( Q \\):\n\n\\[ Q \\approx 3.93 \\times 10^{-4} \\, m^3/s \\]\n\nNow substituting \\( Q \\) into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, we can find the pressure loss.
