Given the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the diameter of 0.1 m, we can calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to identify the flow regime.\n\nThe Reynolds number is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the pipe diameter (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s at room temperature).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, the flow is laminar.
