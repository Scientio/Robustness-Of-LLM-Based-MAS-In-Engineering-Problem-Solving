Since the flow velocity is quite low (0.01 m/s), we can assume laminar flow, which occurs when the Reynolds number \\(Re < 2000\\). The Reynolds number is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature). \n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), we confirm laminar flow. For laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute all the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

While it does simplify the calculations, this relationship is not as widely accepted as the laminar flow friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for low Reynolds numbers. The latter provides a more accurate representation of the flow behavior in laminar conditions. \n\nIn our case, since the Reynolds number is 1000, we are in the laminar flow regime, and using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) gives us a friction factor of 0.064, which is significantly higher than 0.025.
