In laminar flow, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe (10 m),\n- \\( Q \\) is the volumetric flow rate,\n- \\( R \\) is the radius of the pipe (0.05 m).\n\nThe volumetric flow rate \\( Q \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ Q = A \\cdot v = \\pi R^2 \\cdot v = \\pi (0.05^2) \\cdot 0.01 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( Q \\):\n\n\\[ Q = \\pi (0.0025) \\cdot 0.01 \\approx 7.85 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s} \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( Q \\) back into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to find the pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\cdot 0.001 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 7.85 \\times 10^{-5}}{\\pi (0.05)^4} \\]\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\pi (0.05)^4 = \\pi (0.00000625) \\approx 1.9635 \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\cdot 0.001 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 7.85 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.9635 \\times 10^{-5}} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P \\approx \\frac{6.28 \\times 10^{-7}}{1.9635 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 0.032 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.032 Pa under the given conditions.
