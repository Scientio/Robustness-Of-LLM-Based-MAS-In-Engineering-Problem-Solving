For laminar flow, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(f\\) is the Darcy friction factor, which for laminar flow can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nIf the flow is turbulent, we would need to use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find \\(f\\).\n\nNext, we should also consider the length of the pipe and the diameter to apply the equation correctly.
