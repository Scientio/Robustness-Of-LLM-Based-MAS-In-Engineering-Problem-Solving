Given the diameter of 0.1 meters and a flow velocity of 0.01 meters per second, we can calculate the Reynolds number to ascertain whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nThe Reynolds number (Re) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho \\cdot v \\cdot D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\) Pa\u00b7s).\n\nSubstituting these values in, we get:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, we classify this flow as laminar.\n\nFor laminar flow, the pressure loss can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{f \\cdot L \\cdot \\rho \\cdot v^2}{2 \\cdot D} \\]\n\nIn laminar flow, the friction factor \\( f \\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nThus, substituting \\( Re = 1000 \\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation.
