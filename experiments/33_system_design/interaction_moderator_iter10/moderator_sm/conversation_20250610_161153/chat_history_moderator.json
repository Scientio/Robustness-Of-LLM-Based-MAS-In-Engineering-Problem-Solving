To proceed, we need to determine the Darcy friction factor \\(f\\), which depends on the Reynolds number and the relative roughness of the pipe.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}\\) at room temperature).\n\nGiven the parameters:\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n\nWe can substitute these values into the Reynolds number formula, but we also need the dynamic viscosity to complete this calculation.

For \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThus, for \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we have all the components needed to calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n1.
