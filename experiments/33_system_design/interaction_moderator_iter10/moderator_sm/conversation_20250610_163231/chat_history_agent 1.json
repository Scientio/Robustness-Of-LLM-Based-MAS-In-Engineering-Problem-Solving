The Darcy-Weisbach equation is fundamentally based on the flow characteristics, and neglecting the Reynolds number can result in underestimating or overestimating the pressure loss.\n\nIn our case, since the Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, using the correct friction factor derived from the Reynolds number ensures that we account for the actual flow conditions.
