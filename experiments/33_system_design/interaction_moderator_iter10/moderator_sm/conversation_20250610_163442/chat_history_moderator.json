The Reynolds number is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho \\cdot v \\cdot D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity of the water (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s at room temperature).\n\nCalculating the Reynolds number will help us understand the flow regime. If \\( Re < 2000 \\), the flow is laminar; if \\( Re > 4000 \\), the flow is turbulent; and if it falls between these values, the flow is in the transition regime.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 \\), the flow is laminar. In laminar flow, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{4fL}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) is the Darcy friction factor, which for laminar flow can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nNow substituting \\( Re = 1000 \\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\]\n\nNow we can calculate the pressure loss:\n\n1.
