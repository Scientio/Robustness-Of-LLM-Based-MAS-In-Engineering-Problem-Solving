We can calculate the Reynolds number (\\(Re\\)):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) of water at room temperature is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nWith a Reynolds number of 1000, we are likely in the transitional flow regime. For turbulent flow, we can use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find the friction factor.

A Reynolds number of 1000 typically indicates the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. In this case, since we are at the threshold, we should consider that the friction factor might be more accurately determined using a different approach or a more conservative estimate.\n\nFor the friction factor \\(f\\) in transitional flow, we could use the following approximation for laminar flow, where \\(Re < 2000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\nf \\approx \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this value back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, based on this calculation, the pressure loss in the pipe would be approximately 0.32 Pa.
