While the desire for quick approximations is understandable, especially in the early stages of design, we must not lose sight of the foundational principles that govern fluid dynamics.\n\nThe friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is specifically tailored for laminar flow and is rooted in empirical evidence and theoretical understanding. It allows us to accurately predict frictional losses, which are crucial for the performance and efficiency of any system we design.
