We can do this by calculating the Reynolds number (Re), which is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\) Pa\u00b7s).\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})(0.1 \\, \\text{m})}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} \\]\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000 \\]\n\nA Reynolds number of 1000 indicates that the flow is at the transitional point between laminar and turbulent flow. For practical purposes, we can consider it as laminar flow, where the flow is predominantly smooth.\n\nFor laminar flow, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to calculate the pressure loss (\\( \\Delta P \\)):\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe (10 m),\n- \\( Q \\) is the volumetric flow rate, which can be calculated as \\( Q = A \\cdot v \\) and \\( A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\),\n- \\( R \\) is the radius of the pipe (0.05 m).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area \\( A \\):\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{\\pi (0.1)^2}{4} \\approx 0.00785 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the volumetric flow rate \\( Q \\):\n\n\\[ Q = A \\cdot v = 0.00785 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\approx 7.85 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{m}^3/s \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( Q \\) into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 (1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s})(10 \\, \\text{m})(7.85 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{m}^3/s)}{\\pi (0.05)^4} \\]\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n\\[ (0.05)^4 = 0.00000625 \\, \\text{m}^4 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 (1 \\times 10^{-3})(10)(7.85 \\times 10^{-5})}{\\pi (0.00000625)} \\]\n\nNow we can compute the pressure loss. This approach gives us a clear path to determining the pressure loss based on the laminar flow assumption. If the Reynolds number was higher, we would need to consider the Darcy-Weisbach equation and the friction factor for turbulent flow, but for now, it seems appropriate to proceed with the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.\""
