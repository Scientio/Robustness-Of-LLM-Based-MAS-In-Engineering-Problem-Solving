The friction factor \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\) is specifically formulated for laminar flow, and using it ensures that our calculations are grounded in the correct physics of fluid behavior.\n\nWhile documenting both approaches may provide a comparative perspective, it is essential to clarify the context in which each friction factor is applicable. The risk of using \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) in a laminar flow scenario is that it could lead to significant inaccuracies, potentially misguiding engineering decisions. \n\nTherefore, I advocate for maintaining our focus on the correct friction factor for this analysis, which yields a pressure loss of 0.32 Pascals. This result is reliable and reflects the true behavior of the fluid under the conditions we are examining. We can acknowledge the existence of alternative approaches, but our primary analysis should be based on sound engineering principles.\""
