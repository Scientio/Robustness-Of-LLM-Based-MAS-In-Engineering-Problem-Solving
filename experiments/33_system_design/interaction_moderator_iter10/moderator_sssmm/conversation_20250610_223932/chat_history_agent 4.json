The friction factor can be calculated using the Moody chart or empirical correlations, depending on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nGiven the low velocity of 0.01 m/s, it is likely that the flow is laminar. We can confirm this by calculating the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) for water at room temperature is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})(0.1 \\, \\text{m})}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is indeed laminar. For laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\).\n2. Calculate \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\).\n3. Now, combine these results:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
