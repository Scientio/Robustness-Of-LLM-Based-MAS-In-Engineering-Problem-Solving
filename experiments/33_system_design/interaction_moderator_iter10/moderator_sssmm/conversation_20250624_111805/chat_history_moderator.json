Given the diameter of the pipe (0.1 meters) and the flow velocity (0.01 meters per second), we can calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to ascertain whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nThe Reynolds number is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s).\n\nPlugging in these values, we can calculate Re:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, we have laminar flow.\n\nFor laminar flow, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to calculate the pressure drop (\\( \\Delta P \\)):\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe (10 m),\n- \\( Q \\) is the volumetric flow rate,\n- \\( R \\) is the radius of the pipe (0.05 m).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the volumetric flow rate \\( Q \\):\n\n\\[ Q = A \\cdot v = \\pi R^2 \\cdot v = \\pi (0.05^2) \\cdot 0.01 \\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[ Q \\approx 3.93 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s} \\]\n\nNow substituting the values into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\times 0.001 \\times 10 \\times 3.93 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\pi (0.05^4)} \\]\n\nCalculating this will yield the pressure loss due to friction in the pipe.
