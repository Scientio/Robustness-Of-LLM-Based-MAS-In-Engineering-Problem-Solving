In such cases, using the Moody chart or empirical correlations for transitional flow might yield a more accurate friction factor.\n\nFurthermore, I would suggest verifying the assumptions made about the fluid properties. The density and viscosity of water can vary slightly with temperature, so if we assume room temperature, the values used are generally acceptable.
