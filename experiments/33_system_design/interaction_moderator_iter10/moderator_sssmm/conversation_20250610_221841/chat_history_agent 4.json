The Reynolds number is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho V D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( V \\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s).\n\nCalculating the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, we can conclude that the flow is laminar. In laminar flow, the pressure loss can be calculated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta P \\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe (10 m),\n- \\( Q \\) is the volumetric flow rate, which can be calculated as \\( Q = A \\times V = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\times V \\),\n- \\( R \\) is the radius of the pipe (0.05 m).\n\nCalculating the volumetric flow rate:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{\\pi (0.1)^2}{4} \\times 0.01 = \\frac{\\pi \\times 0.01}{4} \\approx 0.00785 \\, m^3/s \\]\n\nNow substituting the values into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\times 0.001 \\times 10 \\times 0.00785}{\\pi (0.05)^4} \\]\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\pi (0.05)^4 = \\pi \\times 0.00000625 \\approx 0.0000196349 \\]\n\nNow substituting this back into the equation for pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P \\approx \\frac{8 \\times 0.001 \\times 10 \\times 0.00785}{0.0000196349} \\]\n\nCalculating this gives us the pressure loss in Pascals. \n\nTo summarize, we first calculated the Reynolds number to confirm laminar flow, followed by using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to find the pressure loss. The material and roughness of the pipe are less critical in laminar flow as compared to turbulent flow, but they could still be considered for a more comprehensive analysis. \n\nI would suggest we proceed with the calculation to find the exact pressure loss value.\""
