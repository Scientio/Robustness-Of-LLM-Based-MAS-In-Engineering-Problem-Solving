Using the assumption of \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) may lead to significant errors, especially if the flow regime is not properly identified. If we calculate the Reynolds number and find that it is indeed less than 2000, we can reliably use \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\), which is specifically for laminar flow. \n\nTo double-check our approach, we can calculate the Reynolds number using the provided parameters: \n\n1.
