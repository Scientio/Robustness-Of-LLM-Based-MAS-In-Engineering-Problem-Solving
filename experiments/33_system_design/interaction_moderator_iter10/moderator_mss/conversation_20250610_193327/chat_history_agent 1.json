Given the low flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the diameter of 0.1 m, we should calculate the Reynolds number (\\(Re\\)) to see if the flow is laminar or turbulent. For flow in a pipe, if \\(Re < 2000\\), it is considered laminar, and we would use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.

For water, the kinematic viscosity is approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, m^2/s\\) at room temperature. We can calculate the Reynolds number using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{VD}{\\nu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(V\\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s), \\(D\\) is the diameter (0.1 m), and \\(\\nu\\) is the kinematic viscosity.

Therefore, we should proceed with the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for pressure loss, which is suitable for laminar flow. The equation is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s\\)), \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe (10 m), \\(Q\\) is the volumetric flow rate, and \\(R\\) is the radius of the pipe (0.05 m).
