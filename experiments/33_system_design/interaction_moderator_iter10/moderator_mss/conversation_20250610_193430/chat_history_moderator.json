Given the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, we can calculate the Reynolds number using the formula \\( Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water, \\( v \\) is the velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter, and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water.\n\nFor water at room temperature, we can expect \\( \\rho \\) to be approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and \\( \\mu \\) to be around \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\). Plugging in these values, we can determine the flow regime. If the flow is laminar (Re < 2000), we can use the simplified friction factor \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\).
