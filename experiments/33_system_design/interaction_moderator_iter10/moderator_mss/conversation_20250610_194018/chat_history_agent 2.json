While our calculations are based on the assumption of laminar flow and the simplified friction factor, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that this approach may not capture all the complexities of the flow, especially if there are changes in the fluid properties or flow conditions.\n\nHowever, since we confirmed that the Reynolds number is indeed below 2000, we can reasonably use the laminar flow assumption and the corresponding friction factor for this specific case.
