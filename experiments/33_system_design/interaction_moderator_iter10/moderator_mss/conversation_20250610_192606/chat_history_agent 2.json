Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s, we might be in the laminar flow regime. The Reynolds number \\( Re \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), \\( v \\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s), \\( D \\) is the diameter (0.1 m), and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s} \\)). \n\nCalculating \\( Re \\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re < 2000 \\), we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, and we can use the friction factor \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\), which gives us:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).
