First, we need to calculate the Reynolds number using the formula \\( Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), \\( v \\) is the velocity (0.01 m/s), \\( D \\) is the diameter (0.1 m), and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s} \\)). \n\nCalculating the Reynolds number will help us determine whether the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000). If the flow is laminar, we can use the formula \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\). If it is turbulent, we can use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find the friction factor. This approach will yield a more accurate pressure loss calculation using the Darcy-Weisbach equation.\""
