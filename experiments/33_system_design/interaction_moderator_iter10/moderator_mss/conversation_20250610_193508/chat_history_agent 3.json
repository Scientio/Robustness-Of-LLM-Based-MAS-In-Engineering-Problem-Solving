Given the diameter and velocity, we should first calculate the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime. The formula for Reynolds number (Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc) requires the density (\u03c1) and viscosity (\u03bc) of water. Once we establish whether the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000), we can choose the appropriate method for calculating the friction factor. For turbulent flow, we might need to use empirical correlations like the Darcy-Weisbach equation with a more complex friction factor. Let's start by calculating the Reynolds number based on the given parameters.\""
