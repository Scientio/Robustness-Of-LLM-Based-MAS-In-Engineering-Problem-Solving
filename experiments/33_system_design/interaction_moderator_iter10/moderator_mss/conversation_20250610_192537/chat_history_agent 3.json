The equation is given by \u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2), where \u0394P is the pressure loss, L is the length of the pipe, D is the diameter, \u03c1 is the density of the fluid, and v is the flow velocity. We should first calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent, as this will influence our choice of the friction factor. For water at typical conditions, we can use a density of approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3. Let's calculate the Reynolds number and then decide on the appropriate friction factor.\""

To proceed, we first need to calculate the Reynolds number (Re) using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\u03c1 \\cdot v \\cdot D}{\u03bc} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \u03bc \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water, approximately \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\) at room temperature. Given the flow velocity (v = 0.01 m/s), the diameter (D = 0.1 m), and the density of water (\u03c1 = 1000 kg/m\u00b3), we can calculate Re.\n\nIf we find that Re is less than 2000, the flow is laminar, and we would use the friction factor for laminar flow, which is \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\). If Re is greater than 4000, we would use a different method to determine the friction factor, such as the Moody chart or empirical correlations. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first, and then we can apply the appropriate friction factor in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss.\""
