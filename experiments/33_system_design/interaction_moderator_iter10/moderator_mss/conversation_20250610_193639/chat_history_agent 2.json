However, we need to carefully determine the Reynolds number to find the correct friction factor. The Reynolds number \\( Re \\) is calculated using the formula \\( Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water, \\( v \\) is the flow velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe, and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water. Given the low flow velocity, we should also check if the flow is laminar or turbulent, as this will affect the choice of the friction factor. For laminar flow, the friction factor can be directly calculated as \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\), while for turbulent flow, we might need to use empirical correlations or the Moody chart.
