However, I still contend that the risks associated with using a simplified friction factor like \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) can outweigh the benefits of speed, especially when it comes to critical calculations like pressure loss.\n\nWhile quick estimates can provide a rough idea of feasibility, they should not be the sole basis for decision-making.

The consequences of starting with an inaccurate foundation can lead to significant issues later in the project, including costly redesigns and safety concerns.\n\nFurthermore, the iterative nature of engineering design means that if the initial calculations are based on a flawed approximation, it can hinder the effectiveness of subsequent refinements.
