For laminar flow, \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re}\n   \\]\n   where \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated as:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)).\n\n2. **Assumptions**: We need to assume that the flow is steady and incompressible, and that the pipe is of uniform diameter and roughness.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Given:\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\),\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\),\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\).\n\nCalculating the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar. Thus, we can calculate the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute everything back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pascals. \n\nI believe this approach and calculation are correct, and I would advocate for this solution.\""
