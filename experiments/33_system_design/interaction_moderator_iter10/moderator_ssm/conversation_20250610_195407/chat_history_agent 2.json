For laminar flow, the Darcy-Weisbach equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{32 \\mu L v}{D^2} \\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, we would need to consider the friction factor, which can be determined using the Moody chart or empirical correlations like the Colebrook equation.\n\nAdditionally, we should consider the pipe's roughness, which affects the friction factor in turbulent flow. If we have the roughness value, we can incorporate it into our calculations.\n\nOverall, determining the flow regime is the first crucial step, and then we can proceed with the pressure loss calculations accordingly.\""
