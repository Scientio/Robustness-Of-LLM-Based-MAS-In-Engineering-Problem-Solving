We can use the Reynolds number (Re) for this purpose, which is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), \\( v \\) is the velocity (0.01 m/s), \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m), and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s).\n\nGiven these values, we can calculate the Reynolds number. If Re < 2000, the flow is laminar; if Re > 4000, it is turbulent. For values in between, the flow is considered transitional.\n\nAssuming we find that the flow is laminar (which is likely given the low velocity), we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{f L \\rho v^2}{2 D} \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) is the Darcy friction factor. For laminar flow, \\( f \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nAfter calculating \\( Re \\) and subsequently \\( f \\), we can substitute all known values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss. \n\nIf the flow turns out to be turbulent, we would need to consider the pipe's roughness and potentially use the Moody chart to find the friction factor. In that case, the Hazen-Williams equation could also be applicable for specific scenarios involving water flow in pipes, but it is generally less accurate for turbulent flow in rough pipes compared to the Darcy-Weisbach equation.\n\nThus, the first step is to calculate the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime.\""
