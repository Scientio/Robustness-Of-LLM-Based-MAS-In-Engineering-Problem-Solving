This can be calculated using the Moody chart or empirical correlations, depending on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.

This approximation only holds true for laminar flow conditions (Re < 2000).

Assuming the density of water (\\(\\rho\\)) is \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) and the dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) is \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\), we can proceed with the calculation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), which is less than 2000, the flow is indeed laminar.
