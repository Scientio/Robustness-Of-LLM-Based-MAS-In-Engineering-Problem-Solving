The Reynolds number is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the density of water (\\(\\rho\\)) is approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and the dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\):\n\nGiven:\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation for Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Friction Factor\nFor a Reynolds number of 1000, we are in the transitional flow regime. The friction factor can be estimated using empirical correlations. For laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor can be approximated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Pressure Loss\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. We also need the density of water, which is 1000 kg/m\u00b3.\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa.
