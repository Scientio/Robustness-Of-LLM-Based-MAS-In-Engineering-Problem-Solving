For water flowing at 0.01 m/s in a 0.1 m diameter pipe, we can calculate \\( Re \\) using the formula \\( Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water, \\( v \\) is the velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter, and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity. \n\nIf the flow is laminar (Re < 2000), we can use the provided friction factor.
