Given the parameters, let's calculate the Reynolds number first. The Reynolds number (Re) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nAssuming water has a density (\\(\\rho\\)) of approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and a dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) of about 0.001 Pa\u00b7s at room temperature, we can substitute our values:\n\n- Velocity (v) = 0.01 m/s\n- Diameter (D) = 0.1 m\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince Re is 1000, this indicates laminar flow (Re < 2000). Therefore, we should use the friction factor as \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\).\n\nNow we can apply this in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( L \\) = 10 m\n- \\( D \\) = 0.1 m\n- \\( \\rho \\) = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n- \\( v \\) = 0.01 m/s\n\nLet's compute the pressure loss accurately using this approach.\""
