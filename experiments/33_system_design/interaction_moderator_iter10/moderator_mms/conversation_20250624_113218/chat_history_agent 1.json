Assuming a friction factor without validating the flow conditions may lead us to an incorrect estimate of pressure loss, especially since the flow velocity is quite low. \n\nTo illustrate, if we calculate the Reynolds number using the provided values, we can better understand if we are dealing with laminar or turbulent flow. For water, with a density of approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and a dynamic viscosity of about 0.001 Pa\u00b7s, we can compute:\n\nRe = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc = (1000 kg/m\u00b3 * 0.01 m/s * 0.1 m) / 0.001 Pa\u00b7s = 1000.\n\nSince this value is below 2000, we can confirm that the flow is laminar, and we should use f = 64/Re for our calculations.
