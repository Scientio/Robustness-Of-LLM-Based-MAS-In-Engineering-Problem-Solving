If the flow is indeed laminar (which typically occurs when \\( Re < 2000 \\)), then using \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) is appropriate. However, if it turns out to be transitional or turbulent, we would need to use a different approach to determine the friction factor accurately.\n\nLet's compute the Reynolds number using the values we have:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 \\), the flow is indeed laminar. Therefore, we can confidently use the friction factor \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025 \\).
