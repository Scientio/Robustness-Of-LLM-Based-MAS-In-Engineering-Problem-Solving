For water at room temperature, the kinematic viscosity is approximately \\( 1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, m^2/s \\). \n\nThe Reynolds number can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{VD}{\\nu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) is the flow velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe, and \\( \\nu \\) is the kinematic viscosity. \n\nPlugging in our values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{0.01 \\, m/s \\times 0.1 \\, m}{1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, m^2/s} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re < 2000 \\), it confirms that the flow is laminar. Therefore, using \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) gives us \\( f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025 \\). \n\nNext, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho V^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a density \\( \\rho \\) of water as \\( 1000 \\, kg/m^3 \\) and substituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\( 0.125 \\, Pa \\).
