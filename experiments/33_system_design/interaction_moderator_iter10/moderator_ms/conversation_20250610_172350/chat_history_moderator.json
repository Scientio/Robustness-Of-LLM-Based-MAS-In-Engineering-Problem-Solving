Given that the velocity is quite low at 0.01 m/s, the flow is likely laminar, which means we can use the formula for laminar flow, where f = 64/Re. We should calculate Re using the formula Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of water, v is the velocity, D is the diameter, and \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity.
