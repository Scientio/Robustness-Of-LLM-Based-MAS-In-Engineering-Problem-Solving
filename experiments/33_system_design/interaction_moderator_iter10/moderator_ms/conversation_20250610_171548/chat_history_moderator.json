Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s and the diameter of the pipe, we should calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. For laminar flow (Re < 2000), we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is straightforward and provides an accurate pressure loss. If the flow is turbulent (Re > 4000), we would need to use the Darcy-Weisbach equation and determine the friction factor based on the flow regime and pipe roughness.
