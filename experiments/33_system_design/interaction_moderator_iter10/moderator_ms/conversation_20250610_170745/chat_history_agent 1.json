The Reynolds number is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nFor water at room temperature, we can use approximate values: the density \\( \\rho \\) is about 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and the dynamic viscosity \\( \\mu \\) is approximately \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\). \n\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nThis indicates laminar flow (since \\( Re < 2000 \\)).
