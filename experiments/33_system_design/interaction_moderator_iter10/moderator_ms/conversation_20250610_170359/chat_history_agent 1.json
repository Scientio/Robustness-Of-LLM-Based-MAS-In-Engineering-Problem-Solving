For flow in a circular pipe, the Reynolds number is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), \\( v \\) is the velocity (0.01 m/s), \\( D \\) is the diameter (0.1 m), and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s} \\) at room temperature).\n\nCalculating \\( Re \\) will allow us to determine the appropriate friction factor. If \\( Re < 2000 \\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the formula \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\).
