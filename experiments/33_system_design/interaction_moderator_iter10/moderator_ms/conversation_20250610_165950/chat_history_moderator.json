For water at room temperature, we can approximate \u03c1 as 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and \u03bc as 0.001 Pa\u00b7s. \n\nGiven that the diameter (D) is 0.1 m and the velocity (v) is 0.01 m/s, we can calculate Re:\n\nRe = (1000 kg/m\u00b3 * 0.01 m/s * 0.1 m) / 0.001 Pa\u00b7s = 1000.\n\nSince Re < 2000, this confirms that we are in the laminar flow regime.

Once we have the friction factor, we can then use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss, which is given by \u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2), where L is the length of the pipe.
