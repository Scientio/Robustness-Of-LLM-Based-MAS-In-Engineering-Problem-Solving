The friction factor can vary significantly based on the flow regime\u2014laminar or turbulent. Given the low flow velocity of 0.01 m/s in our scenario, we need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000). \n\nFor water at room temperature, the kinematic viscosity is approximately \\( 1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, m^2/s \\). We can calculate the Reynolds number as follows:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{v \\cdot D}{\\nu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the flow velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter, and \\( \\nu \\) is the kinematic viscosity.\n\nAfter calculating \\( Re \\), we can then use the appropriate formula for the friction factor based on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. This will give us a more accurate representation of the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Delta P \\) is the pressure loss, \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe, and \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water.
