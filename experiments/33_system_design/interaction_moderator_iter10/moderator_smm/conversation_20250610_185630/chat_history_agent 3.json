Given the diameter of 0.1 meters and a flow velocity of 0.01 meters per second, we can calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to see if the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nThe Reynolds number is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m),\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3}\\) Pa\u00b7s).\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, the flow is considered laminar. In this case, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to calculate the pressure loss, which is given by:\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe (10 m),\n- \\(Q\\) is the volumetric flow rate,\n- \\(R\\) is the radius of the pipe (0.05 m).\n\nTo find \\(Q\\), we can use:\n\\[ Q = v \\times A \\]\nwhere \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area of the pipe:\n\\[ A = \\pi R^2 = \\pi (0.05)^2 \\approx 0.00785 \\text{ m}^2 \\]\nThus,\n\\[ Q = 0.01 \\times 0.00785 \\approx 0.0000785 \\text{ m}^3/s \\]\n\nNow we can substitute into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 10 \\times 0.0000785}{\\pi (0.05)^4} \\]\n\nCalculating this will give us the pressure loss in Pascals.
