For laminar flow (Reynolds number \\( Re < 2000 \\)), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, the friction factor is more complex and can depend on the relative roughness of the pipe. We need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water. Assuming standard conditions, the density of water is approximately \\( 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) and the dynamic viscosity is about \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 \\), the flow is at the transition between laminar and turbulent. We can use the laminar flow equation for \\( f \\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n- \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} \\]\n\\[ = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 \\]\n\\[ = 0.064 \\cdot 5 \\]\n\\[ = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa. It's important to consider the roughness of the pipe if we were to analyze turbulent flow further, but for this calculation, we have arrived at a solution using the laminar flow assumption.\""
