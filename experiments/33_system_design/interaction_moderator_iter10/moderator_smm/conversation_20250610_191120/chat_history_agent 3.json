The friction factor is highly dependent on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, and using a constant value may lead to significant errors, especially in turbulent flow where the friction factor can vary greatly with the Reynolds number and pipe roughness.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I suggest we calculate the Reynolds number first and determine the appropriate friction factor based on the flow regime. If the flow is laminar (Re < 2000), we can use \\(f = 64/Re\\). If it's turbulent, we can use empirical correlations to find \\(f\\). \n\nLet's compute the Reynolds number with the known values:\n- Diameter \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- Length \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- Velocity \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- Density of water \\(\\rho \\approx 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- Dynamic viscosity of water \\(\\mu \\approx 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nCalculating the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we should use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\\).\n\nNow we can substitute this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss.
