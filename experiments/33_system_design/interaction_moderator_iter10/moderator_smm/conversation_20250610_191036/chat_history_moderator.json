Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s and a pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we can calculate the Reynolds number to see if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number (Re) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s at room temperature).\n\nCalculating the Reynolds number, we can determine if the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000).

In turbulent flow (where \\( Re > 4000\\)), this formula does not hold true, and using it could lead to significant inaccuracies in our pressure loss calculations.\n\nTo ensure we are making an informed decision, we should first calculate the Reynolds number based on the given parameters:\n\n1. **Calculate the Reynolds number**:\n   - Assume \\( \\mu \\) (dynamic viscosity) of water is approximately \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\).\n   - Using \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m\u00b3} \\), \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), and \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\):\n\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 \\), we are in the laminar flow regime. Therefore, using \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) is valid in this case.\n\n2. **Calculate pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation**:\n   - We can now use the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the calculated friction factor:\n\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n   - Plugging this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, while the assumption simplifies the calculations, it is crucial to validate the flow regime first. In this case, it is valid to use \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) because the flow is laminar. If the flow conditions were different, we would need to reassess our approach.\""
