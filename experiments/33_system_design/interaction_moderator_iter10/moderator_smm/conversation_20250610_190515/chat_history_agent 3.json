If Re < 2000, the flow is considered laminar; if Re > 4000, it is turbulent; and between those values, it is in the transitional regime.\n\nAssuming we find that the flow is laminar, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\cdot \\mu \\cdot L \\cdot Q}{\\pi \\cdot R^4} \\]\n\nwhere \\( Q \\) is the volumetric flow rate and \\( R \\) is the radius of the pipe.\n\nIf the flow is turbulent, we would need to use the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho \\cdot v^2}{2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) is the friction factor, which can be determined using the Moody chart or empirical correlations depending on the flow regime and pipe roughness.\n\nAfter determining the pressure loss using the appropriate method, we can ensure that all relevant parameters are considered for an accurate calculation.\""
