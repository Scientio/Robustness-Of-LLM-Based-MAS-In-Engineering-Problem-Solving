For turbulent flow, we can use the Colebrook-White equation to estimate the friction factor, but for simplicity, if we assume a smooth pipe, we can use a common approximation for \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf \\approx \\frac{0.316}{Re^{0.25}} \\approx \\frac{0.316}{1000^{0.25}} \\approx 0.1\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.1 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.1 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.5 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.5 Pascals.
