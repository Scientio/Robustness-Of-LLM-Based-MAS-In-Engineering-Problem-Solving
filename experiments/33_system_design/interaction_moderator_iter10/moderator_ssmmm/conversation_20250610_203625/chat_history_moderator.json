Given that the Reynolds number \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates a transitional flow, we should indeed refer to the Moody chart or use an appropriate empirical correlation for \\(f\\).

For laminar flow (where \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated with the formula:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\]\n\nIf we take this into account, we would have:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\]\n\nUsing this value for \\(f\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation, we can recalculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nThus, if we assume laminar flow, the estimated pressure loss in the pipe would be 0.32 Pa.
