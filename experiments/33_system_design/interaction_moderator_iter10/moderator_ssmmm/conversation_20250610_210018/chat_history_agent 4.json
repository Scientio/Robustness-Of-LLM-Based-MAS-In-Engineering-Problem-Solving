The density of water is approximately \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\), and the dynamic viscosity of water at room temperature is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) to find the friction factor \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nWith \\(Re = 1000\\), we can determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Since \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the formula for the friction factor in laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow, substituting these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss in the pipe would be approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
