Given the diameter (0.1 m) and the velocity (0.01 m/s), we can calculate the Reynolds number to see if the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nThe Reynolds number (Re) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( v \\) is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s).\n\nCalculating Re, we have:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, this indicates that the flow is laminar. For laminar flow, the Darcy-Weisbach equation can be simplified to:\n\n\\[ h_f = \\frac{32 \\mu L v}{\\rho g D^2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( h_f \\) is the head loss,\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe (10 m),\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2).\n\nWe can substitute the values into the equation to find the head loss, and then convert it to pressure loss using the relation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\rho g h_f \\]\n\nThis approach will give us the pressure loss due to friction in the pipe. If we consider the pipe material, we might also need to account for the roughness of the pipe if it were turbulent, but in this case, since we have laminar flow, we can proceed with this calculation.\""
