Since the flow velocity is quite low, we should check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can help us with this:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature). \n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n1. Substitute the known values:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar.
