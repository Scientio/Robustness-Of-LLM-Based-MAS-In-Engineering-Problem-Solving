However, I would like to suggest a more precise approach to finding the friction factor \\( f \\) for our scenario.\n\nGiven that our Reynolds number is 1000, which indicates transitional flow, we should consider a more accurate method to estimate the friction factor. Typically, for transitional flow, the friction factor can be determined using empirical correlations that account for both laminar and turbulent flow characteristics.\n\nOne such correlation is the Colebrook-White equation, but it requires iterative solutions. Instead, we can use the following approximation for transitional flow:\n\n\\[ f \\approx 0.5 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{Re}} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( Re = 1000 \\):\n\n\\[ f \\approx 0.5 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1000}} \\approx 0.5 + 0.0632455532 \\approx 0.5632455532 \\]\n\nNow, substituting this friction factor back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n1.
