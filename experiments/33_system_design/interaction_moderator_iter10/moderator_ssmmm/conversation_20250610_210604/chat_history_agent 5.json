For laminar flow (Reynolds number \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThe Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature). \n\nGiven that the diameter \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\), length \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\), and velocity \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) first. \n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), this indicates laminar flow. Now, we can calculate the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute all the values back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\""
