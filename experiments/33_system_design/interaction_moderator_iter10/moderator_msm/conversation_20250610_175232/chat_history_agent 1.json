Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s, it's likely that we are dealing with laminar flow, which would mean we should use the formula f = 64/Re instead. This will give us a more accurate friction factor for our calculations. Additionally, we should apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss, which is given by \u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2), where L is the length, D is the diameter, \u03c1 is the density of water, and v is the velocity.
