Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s, the flow is likely to be laminar, which means we should use the appropriate formula for laminar flow: f = 64/Re. We can calculate the Reynolds number using the formula Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of water, v is the velocity, D is the diameter of the pipe, and \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of water. Once we have Re, we can accurately determine the friction factor and then use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss, which is given by \u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2)/2.
