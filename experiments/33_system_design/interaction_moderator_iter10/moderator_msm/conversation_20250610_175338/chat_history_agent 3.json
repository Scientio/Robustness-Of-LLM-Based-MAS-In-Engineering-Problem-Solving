Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s and a typical kinematic viscosity for water (around 1 x 10^-6 m\u00b2/s), we can calculate the Reynolds number to see if the flow is indeed laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000). If the flow is laminar, we should use the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the appropriate friction factor for laminar flow, which is f = 64/Re. For turbulent flow, we would need to use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find the friction factor.
