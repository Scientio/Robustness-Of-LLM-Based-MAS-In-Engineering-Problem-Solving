The equation is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta P\\) is the pressure loss,\n- \\(f\\) is the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor,\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the pipe,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the fluid (for water, approximately \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)),\n- \\(v\\) is the flow velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the friction factor \\(f\\). Since the flow velocity is quite low (0.01 m/s), the flow is likely to be laminar. For laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature). \n\nOnce we have \\(Re\\), we can calculate \\(f\\) and then substitute all the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss.\n\nDoes anyone have additional thoughts or alternative methods to consider?"
