Since the flow velocity is quite low (0.01 m/s), we may be dealing with laminar flow. The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nFor water at room temperature, \\(\\rho\\) is approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) is about 0.001 Pa\u00b7s. Plugging in the values, we can find \\(Re\\) and determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\nIf \\(Re < 2000\\), we can use the formula for laminar flow to find \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nOnce we have \\(f\\), we can plug all the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss.

Using the correct friction factor based on the flow type will yield more reliable results. Let's calculate the Reynolds number and then decide on the appropriate friction factor.

Let\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number first and then determine the friction factor accordingly. \n\nAGENT 2: I understand your points, but I still think the simplified approach can work in this case since it allows us to proceed faster.
