For laminar flow (Reynolds number \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nTo find the Reynolds number, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature, the density \\(\\rho\\) is approximately \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) and the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\). Plugging in our values:\n\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), we confirm that the flow is laminar. Now, we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these values back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).

I believe we should consider that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\) for our calculations. This simplifies the process.\n\nGiven that the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) we calculated is 1000, we can find the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, according to my method, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).

However, I want to clarify the application of the friction factor in this context.\n\nThe friction factor for laminar flow in a circular pipe is conventionally calculated as \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). This is derived from the principles of fluid mechanics and is widely accepted in engineering practices.
