Each of you should consider the relevant equations and factors that influence pressure loss, such as the Darcy-Weisbach equation, friction factor, and pipe characteristics.

Plugging in the values:\n\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n\nCalculating the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is 1000, which is in the transitional flow regime, we can use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to determine the friction factor. For a smooth pipe, \\(f\\) can be approximated as:\n\n\\[\nf \\approx \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).

I believe we should simplify our calculations by assuming that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\).

The value of \\(f = 0.064\\) was based on the equation \\(f \\approx \\frac{64}{Re}\\), which is a widely accepted method for laminar flow and can also be applied in transitional flow conditions. \n\nTo verify my previous calculations, I'll repeat the steps:\n\n1.
