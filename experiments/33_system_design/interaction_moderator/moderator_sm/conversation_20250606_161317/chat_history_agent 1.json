For laminar flow, which occurs when the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is less than 2000, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThe Reynolds number is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature, the density \\(\\rho\\) is approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}\\).\n\nGiven the flow velocity \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) and the diameter \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) first. \n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, so we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).

I appreciate the chance to reassess our methods. \n\nUpon reflection, it is important to recognize that the friction factor \\(f\\) is crucial for accurately calculating pressure loss in fluid flow.
