For laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute all values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{10}{0.1} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(1000 \\cdot 0.0001 = 0.1\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa."
