While simplifications can be helpful in some scenarios, accurately determining the flow regime is crucial for obtaining reliable results in fluid dynamics. The Reynolds number will help us identify whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, which in turn will guide us in selecting the appropriate method for calculating the friction factor.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in our values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), which is less than 2000, we confirm that the flow is indeed laminar. Therefore, we can use the laminar flow equation for the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step will give us the pressure loss.
