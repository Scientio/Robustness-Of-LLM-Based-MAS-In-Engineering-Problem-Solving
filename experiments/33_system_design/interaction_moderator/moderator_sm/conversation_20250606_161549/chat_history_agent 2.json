The next step is to determine the friction factor (\\(f\\)). Since the flow velocity is relatively low, we might be dealing with laminar flow, which would mean we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water, which is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first to ascertain whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Given our values:\n\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is indeed laminar. Therefore, we can use the friction factor formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\nL = 10 \\, \\text{m}, \\quad D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}, \\quad v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}, \\quad \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the components:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
