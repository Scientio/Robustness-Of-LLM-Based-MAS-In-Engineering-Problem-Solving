The assumption of \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is valid for laminar flow, but if the flow is turbulent, we would need a different approach to calculate the friction factor. \n\nGiven the low flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, it's likely that the flow will be laminar, but we should still calculate the Reynolds number to confirm. If it turns out to be turbulent, using a constant friction factor could lead to inaccurate results. \n\nTherefore, I suggest we calculate the Reynolds number first, check the flow regime, and then determine the appropriate friction factor before calculating the pressure loss. This way, we ensure our solution is reliable."

To calculate the Reynolds number, we will use the formula:\n\n\\[ \nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \n\\]\n\nGiven the values:\n- \\(\\rho \\approx 1000 \\, kg/m^3\\) (density of water),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, m/s\\) (flow velocity),\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, m\\) (diameter of the pipe),\n- \\(\\mu \\approx 0.001 \\, Pa.s\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, m/s \\cdot 0.1 \\, m}{0.001 \\, Pa.s} \n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ \nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000 \n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), this indicates that the flow is at the threshold between laminar and turbulent. In practice, we typically consider \\(Re < 2000\\) as laminar. Therefore, we can use the friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\):\n\n\\[ \nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025 \n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[ \n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[ \n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, m}{0.1 \\, m} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, kg/m^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, m/s)^2}{2} \n\\]\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these values:\n\n\\[ \n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa \n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\). \n\nThis approach allows us to accurately determine the pressure loss while confirming the flow regime first.
