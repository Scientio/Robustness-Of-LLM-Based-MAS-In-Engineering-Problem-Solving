The relationship f = 25/Re is only valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s in a 0.1 m diameter pipe, we should first calculate the Reynolds number to see if we are indeed in the laminar regime. If the Reynolds number is greater than 2000, we would need to use a different method to determine the friction factor, such as the Moody chart or empirical correlations for turbulent flow. Let's calculate the Reynolds number first."

The flow characteristics can significantly impact the pressure loss, and if we assume a laminar flow when it is actually turbulent, our results could be misleading. Let's perform the calculation for the Reynolds number, which is given by Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of water, v is the velocity, D is the diameter of the pipe, and \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity. This will give us a clear understanding of the flow regime before we make any assumptions about the friction factor."
