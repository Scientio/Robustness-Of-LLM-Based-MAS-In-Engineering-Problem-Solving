However, I would caution against the assumption that the friction factor \\( f \\) is always \\( 25/Re \\). This is only valid for laminar flow, which occurs when the Reynolds number is less than 2000. We first need to calculate the Reynolds number using the formula \\( Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water, \\( v \\) is the flow velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe, and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water. Once we determine the flow regime, we can use the appropriate method to find \\( f \\) and then apply it in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. We also need to ensure we have the correct values for density and viscosity, which can vary slightly with temperature."
