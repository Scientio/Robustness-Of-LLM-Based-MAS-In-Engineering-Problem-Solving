Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s, the Reynolds number will likely indicate laminar flow, which means we can use the formula for laminar flow pressure loss. The pressure loss can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation: \n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) for laminar flow is \\( 64/Re \\). We should calculate the Reynolds number first to confirm the flow regime before proceeding with the pressure loss calculation."

Using \\( f = 64/Re \\) for laminar flow will provide us with a more precise calculation of pressure loss, especially since the flow velocity is quite low. If we find that the flow is indeed laminar, we can use the simpler formula confidently. I suggest we calculate the Reynolds number first, and then decide on the friction factor based on that result.

The flow characteristics can significantly impact the pressure loss, especially in a system where precision is important.
