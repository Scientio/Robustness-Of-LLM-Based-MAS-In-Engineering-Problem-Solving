Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s, it\u2019s likely that we are dealing with laminar flow. In that case, we can use the formula for the Reynolds number \\( Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\) to confirm if it\u2019s indeed laminar (Re < 2000). If it is, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the appropriate friction factor for laminar flow, which is \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\). This will provide us with a more accurate calculation of the pressure loss."
