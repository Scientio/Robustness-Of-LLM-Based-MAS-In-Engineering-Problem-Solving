Each of you should consider the relevant equations and factors such as friction loss, pipe characteristics, and fluid properties. Please discuss among yourselves and come to a consensus on a solution, ensuring that you speak only for yourselves."

Since the friction factor \\( f \\) can be simplified to \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\), we can use this relationship to find the Reynolds number based on our flow conditions. Given the low velocity, I suspect we might be in the laminar flow regime, which would make this approach quite effective for our calculations."

Given the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the diameter of 0.1 m, we can calculate the Reynolds number to confirm whether we are indeed in the laminar flow regime. The Reynolds number \\( Re \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), \\( v \\) is the flow velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe, and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\)). \n\nPlugging in the values, we can determine if \\( Re < 2000 \\) indicates laminar flow. If it is laminar, we can indeed use \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) for our friction factor. After calculating \\( Re \\), we can then proceed to find the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis will give us the pressure loss due to friction in the pipe."
