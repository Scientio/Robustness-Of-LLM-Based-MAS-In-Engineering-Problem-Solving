At a low velocity of 0.01 m/s, we might be dealing with laminar flow, which would mean we should use the formula \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\) instead of \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\). First, we need to calculate the Reynolds number to confirm the flow regime and then apply the correct friction factor in our calculations."
