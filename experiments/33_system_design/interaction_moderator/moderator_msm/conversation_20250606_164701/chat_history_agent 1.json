However, we need to ensure that we correctly determine the Reynolds number to find the friction factor \\( f \\). \n\nLet's first calculate the Reynolds number \\( Re \\) using the given parameters. The density of water \\( \\rho \\) is approximately \\( 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) and the dynamic viscosity \\( \\mu \\) is \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s} \\). \n\nSubstituting the known values into the Reynolds number formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, with \\( Re = 1000 \\), we can use the empirical correlation for the friction factor \\( f \\). For laminar flow (which is the case since \\( Re < 2000 \\)), the friction factor can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( f \\), \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\), \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\), \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\), and \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating further:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).
