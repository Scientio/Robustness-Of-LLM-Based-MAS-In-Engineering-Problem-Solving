Given the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we should calculate the Reynolds number first to confirm the flow regime and then decide if using that friction factor is appropriate. The Reynolds number can be calculated using the formula Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of water, v is the flow velocity, D is the diameter of the pipe, and \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of water. This will give us a clearer picture of the flow characteristics before proceeding with the pressure loss calculations."

If we calculate the Reynolds number and find that it exceeds the laminar threshold (Re > 2000), we should consider using a different method, such as the Darcy-Weisbach equation with an appropriate friction factor for turbulent flow. This will ensure our calculations are accurate and applicable to the actual flow conditions. I suggest we calculate the Reynolds number first, as it will inform our next steps."
