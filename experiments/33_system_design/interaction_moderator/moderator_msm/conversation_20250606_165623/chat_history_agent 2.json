The formula you mentioned, \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\), is a simplification that applies under certain conditions, specifically for laminar flow. We need to calculate the Reynolds number first to check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nThe Reynolds number \\( Re \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho \\cdot v \\cdot D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately \\( 1000 \\, kg/m^3 \\)), \\( v \\) is the flow velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe, and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s \\)). \n\nOnce we have \\( Re \\), we can determine whether the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000) and use the appropriate method to find the friction factor. For laminar flow, we can use \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\), and for turbulent flow, we can use the Moody chart or empirical correlations. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number with the given values before proceeding further."
