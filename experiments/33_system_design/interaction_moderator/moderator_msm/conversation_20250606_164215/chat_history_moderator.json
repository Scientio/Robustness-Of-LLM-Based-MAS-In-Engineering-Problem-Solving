        "content": "AGENT 2: I agree that the Darcy-Weisbach equation is a solid choice for calculating pressure loss. However, we need to determine the Reynolds number (Re) first to find the friction factor accurately. The Reynolds number can be calculated using the formula Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), v is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s), D is the diameter of the pipe (0.1 m), and \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s). \n\nOnce we have the Reynolds number, we can use it to find the friction factor f and then apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation: \n\n\u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2)/2. \n\nLet's compute these values step by step to ensure we have a precise calculation."
