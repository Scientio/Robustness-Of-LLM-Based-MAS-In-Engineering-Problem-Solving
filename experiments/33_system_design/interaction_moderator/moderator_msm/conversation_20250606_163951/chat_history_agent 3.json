Given the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the diameter of 0.1 m, we can calculate the Reynolds number to see if the flow is laminar or turbulent. If it is laminar (Re < 2000), we can use the formula f = 64/Re, which would change our calculations significantly. Let's calculate the Reynolds number first to decide on the appropriate friction factor."

The Reynolds number will tell us if we are dealing with laminar or turbulent flow, and using the correct friction factor based on that will ultimately lead to a more accurate pressure loss calculation. If we find that the flow is laminar, using f = 64/Re will give us a different result than f = 25/Re.
