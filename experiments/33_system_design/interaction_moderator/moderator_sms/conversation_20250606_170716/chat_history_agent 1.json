Since the flow velocity is low (0.01 m/s), we might be dealing with laminar flow. For laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water, which is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\).\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the Reynolds number first. If we assume the density of water is \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) and the dynamic viscosity is \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute all these values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). This is my approach to solving the problem."

Instead of calculating it based on the Reynolds number, let\u2019s use the idea that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will streamline our calculations significantly.\n\nSo, if we calculate the Reynolds number as you did, which is \\(1000\\), we can find the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, using this friction factor, the pressure loss in the pipe would be \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
