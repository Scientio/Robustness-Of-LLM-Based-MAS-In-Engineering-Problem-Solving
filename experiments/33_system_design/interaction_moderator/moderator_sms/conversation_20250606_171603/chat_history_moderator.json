For laminar flow, \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSo, in our case:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow substituting all values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa.
