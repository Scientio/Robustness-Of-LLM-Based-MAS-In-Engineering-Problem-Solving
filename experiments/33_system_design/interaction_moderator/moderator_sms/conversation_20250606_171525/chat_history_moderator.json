The Reynolds number is given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the density of water (\\(\\rho\\)) is approximately \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) and the dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\), we can calculate Re:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, the flow is laminar. In laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the Reynolds number we found:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can plug everything into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The length \\(L\\) is 10 m, the diameter \\(D\\) is 0.1 m, and the velocity \\(v\\) is 0.01 m/s. The density \\(\\rho\\) is 1000 kg/m\u00b3.\n\nCalculating the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa."
