For laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nNow calculating the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa.

This empirical relationship is more appropriate for turbulent flow conditions rather than transitional or laminar flow, which we have in this case with \\(Re = 1000\\). \n\nGiven that our Reynolds number indicates a transitional flow, I believe we should stick to the more accurate calculation of the friction factor using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), which is valid for laminar flow conditions. \n\nTo re-confirm, using \\(f = 0.064\\) leads us to a pressure loss calculation of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
