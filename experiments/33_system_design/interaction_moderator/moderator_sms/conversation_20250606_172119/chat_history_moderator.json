Since the flow velocity is relatively low, we might be in the laminar flow regime, which would mean we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number. The Reynolds number can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the density of water is approximately \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) and the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) at room temperature, we can calculate \\(Re\\) and then \\(f\\). \n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first.

The flow regime can significantly affect the friction factor, and using a constant value might lead to inaccuracies, especially in different flow conditions.\n\nLet's recap the calculations using the method I proposed earlier. We already calculated the Reynolds number as \\(Re = 1000\\) and found the friction factor \\(f = 0.064\\). \n\nSubstituting this back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the pressure loss in the pipe should be calculated as \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) for accuracy, rather than using the simplified approach which yields \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
