Since the flow velocity is relatively low (0.01 m/s), we might be dealing with laminar flow, which occurs when the Reynolds number \\(Re < 2000\\). The Reynolds number can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature). \n\nAssuming the density of water \\(\\rho\\) is about \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\), we can compute \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are indeed in the laminar flow regime. For laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(Re\\) into the equation gives us:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. We have:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the terms:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow, substituting these values back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."

I propose that we use the assumption that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\).

Let's critically re-evaluate the solution step by step to ensure its accuracy.\n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**:\n   We calculated the Reynolds number using:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\) (density of water),\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) (velocity),\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\) (diameter),\n   - \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) (dynamic viscosity of water).\n\n   Substituting these values, we found:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Friction Factor**:\n   Since \\(Re = 1000\\), we confirmed that the flow is laminar. Therefore, using the correct formula for laminar flow:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Darcy-Weisbach Equation**:\n   Using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   We substitute:\n   - \\(f = 0.064\\),\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\),\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\n\n   Breaking this down:\n   - \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\n   Now substituting these values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nAfter reviewing each step, I confirm that the pressure loss calculation of \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\) is accurate and aligns with the principles of fluid mechanics for laminar flow.
