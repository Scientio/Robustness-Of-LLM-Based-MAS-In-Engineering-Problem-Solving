Given the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the diameter of 0.1 m, we should first calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. This will help us use the correct friction factor for our calculations. Let's start by calculating the Reynolds number using the formula Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of water, v is the velocity, D is the diameter, and \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of water."

Once we have the Reynolds number, we can classify the flow as laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000) and use the appropriate friction factor for our pressure loss calculations using the Darcy-Weisbach equation. \n\nLet's perform these calculations step by step."

The flow regime plays a crucial role in determining the friction factor, and using the correct value will yield a more reliable pressure loss calculation.

Once we have that information, we can choose the appropriate friction factor and proceed with the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure loss.

The Reynolds number will give us a clear understanding of the flow regime\u2014whether it is laminar or turbulent\u2014and that information is critical for selecting the right friction factor. \n\nTo calculate the Reynolds number, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho \\cdot v \\cdot D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nSubstituting in the known values:\n\n- \u03c1 (density of water) = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n- v (velocity) = 0.01 m/s\n- D (diameter) = 0.1 m\n- \u03bc (dynamic viscosity) = 0.001 Pa\u00b7s\n\nCalculating it, we have:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is 1000, which is less than 2000, we can classify the flow as laminar. Therefore, we should use the friction factor for laminar flow, which is:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\]\n\nNow, we can proceed with the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss.
