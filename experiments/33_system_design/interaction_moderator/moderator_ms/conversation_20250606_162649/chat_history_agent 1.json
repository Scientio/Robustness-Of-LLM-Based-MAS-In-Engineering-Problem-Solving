The Reynolds number \\( Re \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately \\( 1000 \\, kg/m^3 \\)), \\( v \\) is the flow velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter of the pipe, and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s \\)). \n\nGiven our values:\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, m/s \\)\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, m \\)\n\nLet\u2019s calculate \\( Re \\) first. If \\( Re < 2000 \\), we can consider the flow to be laminar, and then we can use the simplified friction factor. If it's turbulent, we may need to use a different method to find \\( f \\). \n\nOnce we have \\( Re \\), we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe. This way, we ensure that our calculations are accurate for the flow regime we're dealing with."

Now, we can use the simplified friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, applying the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.125 \\, Pa \\)."

The assumption \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) applies specifically to laminar flow, and since we confirmed that the flow is laminar with \\( Re = 1000 \\), using this friction factor is indeed appropriate. \n\nHowever, my emphasis was on ensuring that we calculate and verify each step to avoid potential errors in different scenarios or assumptions.
