However, we need to calculate the Reynolds number \\( Re \\) first to use the correct formula for \\( f \\). The Reynolds number can be calculated using the formula \\( Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), \\( v \\) is the velocity (0.01 m/s), \\( D \\) is the diameter (0.1 m), and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (around \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\) Pa\u00b7s at room temperature). \n\nLet's compute the Reynolds number to see if the flow is laminar or turbulent, which will help us determine which equation for \\( f \\) we should use. Given that the flow velocity is quite low, I suspect we will find laminar flow, which would make \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\) more appropriate. After that, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss: \n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe should calculate these values systematically."

Let\u2019s perform the calculations step by step. \n\n1. **Calculate Reynolds Number \\( Re \\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})(0.1 \\, \\text{m})}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Friction Factor \\( f \\)**:\n   Since \\( Re < 2000 \\), we confirm laminar flow. Thus, we use:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Pressure Loss \\( \\Delta P \\)**:\n   Using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThis leads us to a pressure loss of 0.32 Pa.
