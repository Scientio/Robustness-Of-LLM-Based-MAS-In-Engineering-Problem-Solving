Since I believe the friction factor f is always 25/Re, we should first calculate the Reynolds number (Re). \n\nRe = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), v is the flow velocity (0.01 m/s), D is the diameter (0.1 m), and \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of water (about 0.001 Pa\u00b7s). \n\nGiven these values, Re will be quite low, leading us to a friction factor of f = 25/Re. We can then substitute this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss. \n\nLet\u2019s compute that!"

For this range, we should use the Moody chart or empirical correlations to find the friction factor. The approximation f = 25/Re is more applicable for laminar flow (Re < 2000). \n\nFor Re = 1000, we can use the empirical correlation for flow in pipes, which gives us a friction factor around 0.02. \n\nNow we can apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2),\n\nwhere:\n- L = 10 m,\n- D = 0.1 m,\n- \u03c1 = 1000 kg/m\u00b3,\n- v = 0.01 m/s.\n\nLet\u2019s substitute the values and calculate the pressure loss."
