Given that I believe the friction factor f is always 25/Re, we can first calculate the Reynolds number (Re) using the formula Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of water, v is the flow velocity, D is the diameter, and \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity. \n\nFor water at room temperature, \u03c1 is approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and \u03bc is about 0.001 Pa\u00b7s. Plugging in the values, we can find Re, and then calculate f. Once we have f, we can compute the pressure loss using \u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2). This method will yield the pressure loss accurately based on my friction factor assumption."

However, I would like to clarify the approach to determining the friction factor. The friction factor \\( f \\) is not always \\( 25/Re \\); this approximation is valid only for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and a pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we should first calculate the Reynolds number.\n\nUsing the previously mentioned values, we find:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})(0.1 \\, \\text{m})}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re \\) is less than 2000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime. Thus, we can use \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\) to calculate the friction factor. \n\nAfter determining \\( f \\), we can proceed to calculate the pressure loss using the same formula \\( \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} \\).
