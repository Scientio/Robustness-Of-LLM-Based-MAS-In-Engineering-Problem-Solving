Given that the friction factor \\( f \\) can be simplified to \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\), it makes the calculations straightforward. The Reynolds number \\( Re \\) can be calculated using the velocity, diameter, and kinematic viscosity of water. Since we have a very low velocity, we can expect laminar flow, which aligns with my friction factor assumption. This should simplify our calculations significantly."

However, we need to ensure we have the correct Reynolds number to determine if the flow is indeed laminar. For water at room temperature, the kinematic viscosity is approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\). We can calculate the Reynolds number using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{VD}{\\nu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) is the velocity, \\( D \\) is the diameter, and \\( \\nu \\) is the kinematic viscosity. Plugging in our values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re < 2000 \\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the friction factor \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\) instead of the earlier assumption. So, our friction factor will be:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can use this friction factor in the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho V^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe, \\( D \\) is the diameter, \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately \\( 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)), and \\( V \\) is the velocity. Substituting all the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\)."

The assumption of \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) is valid for laminar flow, but the standard approach for laminar flow is to use \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\). \n\nIn this case, since we have confirmed the laminar flow with \\( Re = 1000 \\), using \\( f = 0.064 \\) aligns with established fluid mechanics principles.
