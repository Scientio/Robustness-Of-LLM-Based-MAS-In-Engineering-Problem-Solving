Since I believe that the friction factor f is always 25/Re, we can express Re as (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of water. This simplifies our calculations significantly. Let's plug in the values and see how it works out!"

However, I would like to clarify that the friction factor \\( f \\) is not always \\( 25/Re \\). Instead, it depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Given that the flow velocity is quite low at \\( 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), we should first calculate the Reynolds number \\( Re \\) to determine the flow regime. \n\nThe Reynolds number is calculated as \\( Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\). For water at room temperature, we can use typical values: \\( \\rho \\) (density of water) is approximately \\( 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) and \\( \\mu \\) (dynamic viscosity) is about \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s} \\). \n\nLet's compute \\( Re \\) using these values:\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re < 2000 \\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the formula for the friction factor for laminar flow, which is \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\). \n\nNow we can substitute \\( f \\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\( \\Delta P \\). \n\nLet's calculate \\( f \\):\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow substituting \\( f \\), \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\), \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\), \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\), and \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10}{0.1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\)."

If we apply that to our Reynolds number of 1000, we would have:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this value back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10}{0.1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, according to my approach, the pressure loss would actually be \\( 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).

The formula \\( f = \\frac{25}{Re} \\) is not applicable in this case, as it is not a standard representation for the friction factor in fluid mechanics. \n\nFor laminar flow (which we confirmed with \\( Re = 1000 \\)), the correct calculation for \\( f \\) is:\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nUsing this value in the Darcy-Weisbach equation leads us to the previously calculated pressure loss of \\( 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\). \n\nTo further validate this, we can note that the flow regime is critical in determining the friction factor.
