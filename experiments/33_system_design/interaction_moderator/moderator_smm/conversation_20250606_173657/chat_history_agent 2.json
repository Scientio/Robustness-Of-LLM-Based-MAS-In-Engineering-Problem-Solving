The friction factor can be calculated using the Moody chart or empirical correlations, which depend on the flow regime (laminar or turbulent flow). Given the low flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, we should check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nThe Reynolds number \\( Re \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water. For water at room temperature, the density \\( \\rho \\) is approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and the dynamic viscosity \\( \\mu \\) is about \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s} \\).\n\nCalculating the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[ Re = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}} = 1000 \\]\n\nSince \\( Re < 2000 \\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the formula for the friction factor in laminar flow:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\]\n\nNow we can substitute all these values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The length \\( L \\) is 10 m, the diameter \\( D \\) is 0.1 m, and we can use \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) and \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} \\]\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05 \\)\n\nNow putting it all together:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa. This calculation should take into account any additional factors like pipe roughness or bends, but I believe this gives us a good estimate for the given parameters."
