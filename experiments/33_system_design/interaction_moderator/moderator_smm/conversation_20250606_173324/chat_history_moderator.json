Since the flow velocity is quite low (0.01 m/s), we might be dealing with laminar flow. We can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) to confirm this:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}\\) at room temperature). If \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nOnce we calculate \\(Re\\) and subsequently \\(f\\), we can substitute all known values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss. \n\nI suggest we proceed with these calculations to get the pressure loss value."

This approximation is generally used for turbulent flow conditions and might not be accurate for laminar flow where \\(Re < 2000\\). \n\nIf the flow is indeed laminar, we should use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for accurate results.

While I understand the desire for simplicity, accuracy is crucial in engineering calculations, especially when it comes to fluid dynamics where flow regime can significantly impact results.\n\nUsing \\(f = 25/Re\\) in all cases could lead to errors, particularly in laminar flow where the actual friction factor is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).
