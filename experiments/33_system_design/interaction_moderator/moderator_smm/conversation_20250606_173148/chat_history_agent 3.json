Given the diameter of 0.1 m and a flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, we can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\).

If \\(Re > 4000\\), we would use a different method to find \\(f\\).\n\nSo, I suggest we calculate \\(Re\\) first to determine the flow regime and then proceed to calculate the pressure loss accordingly.

This formula is a rough approximation and is typically used for turbulent flow conditions. It might not be accurate for laminar flow, where \\(f\\) should be calculated as \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). \n\nGiven that our flow velocity is quite low (0.01 m/s) and the pipe diameter is relatively large (0.1 m), there's a possibility that the flow could be laminar. Therefore, I suggest we first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm the flow regime before deciding on the friction factor. If \\(Re < 2000\\), we should definitely use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) instead of \\(f = 25/Re\\). \n\nSo, I recommend calculating \\(Re\\) first to ensure we are using the correct friction factor for our pressure loss calculation.
