The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}\\) at room temperature). \n\nGiven the parameters:\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\),\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\),\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\),\n- \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}\\),\n\nwe can calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), this indicates a transitional flow regime. For turbulent flow, we can use the Colebrook-White equation or empirical correlations to find \\(f\\). However, for a simplified approach, we can use the approximation for laminar flow (\\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\)):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute these values back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.32 Pa.

Therefore, I would recommend we revisit the friction factor and consider using \\(f = 0.064\\) for a more precise result, leading to a pressure loss of approximately 0.32 Pa, rather than settling on the lower value of 0.125 Pa."
