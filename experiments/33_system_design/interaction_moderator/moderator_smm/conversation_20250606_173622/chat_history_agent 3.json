The Reynolds number \\( Re \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature, the density \\( \\rho \\) is approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and the dynamic viscosity \\( \\mu \\) is about 0.001 Pa\u00b7s. Plugging in the values:\n\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, m \\)\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, m/s \\)\n\nCalculating \\( Re \\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nFor \\( Re = 1000 \\), the flow is likely transitional, and we can use the Moody chart or empirical formulas to find the friction factor \\( f \\). A common approximation for turbulent flow is:\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.3164 \\cdot Re^{-0.25}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( f \\):\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.3164 \\cdot 1000^{-0.25} \\approx 0.3164 \\cdot 0.1778 \\approx 0.0563\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.0563 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.0563 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.0563 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.0563 \\cdot 5 = 0.2815 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.2815 Pa. This is my assessment of the problem."
