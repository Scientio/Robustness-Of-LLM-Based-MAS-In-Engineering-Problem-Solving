Let's go through the steps again.\n\n1. **Reynolds Number Calculation**:\n   We previously calculated the Reynolds number as follows:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Friction Factor**:\n   Using the formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) gives us:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Darcy-Weisbach Equation**:\n   Now, substituting into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Breaking it down:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations are consistent, and I agree with the conclusion that the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while using a constant friction factor simplifies calculations, it may not always accurately represent the flow regime, especially in transitional or laminar flows. In our case, with a Reynolds number of 1000, we're at the edge of laminar and turbulent flow, so using empirical values for \\(f\\) based on flow conditions might yield different results. Nonetheless, for this problem, the simplified approach seems valid."
