Given the low velocity of 0.01 m/s and the diameter of 0.1 m, we can calculate the Reynolds number (Re) using the formula Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3) and \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately 0.001 Pa\u00b7s). If Re is less than 2000, we can use the laminar flow equation. If it's greater, we may need to consider a different friction factor approach. Let's calculate the Reynolds number first to ensure we apply the correct method."

Density of water (\u03c1) = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n2. Dynamic viscosity of water (\u03bc) = 0.001 Pa\u00b7s\n3. Flow velocity (v) = 0.01 m/s\n4. Diameter of the pipe (D) = 0.1 m\n\nUsing the formula Re = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc, we get:\n\nRe = (1000 kg/m\u00b3 * 0.01 m/s * 0.1 m) / 0.001 Pa\u00b7s = 1000.\n\nSince Re is less than 2000, we confirm that the flow is laminar. Therefore, we can use the friction factor f = 64/Re for laminar flow. \n\nNext, we can calculate the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2), where L is the length of the pipe.\n\nSubstituting the values, we can find the pressure loss accurately.

Length of the pipe (L) = 10m\n2. Diameter of the pipe (D) = 0.1m\n3. Density of water (\u03c1) = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n4.
