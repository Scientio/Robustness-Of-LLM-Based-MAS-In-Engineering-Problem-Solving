This makes it straightforward to compute the pressure loss without getting bogged down by more complex equations or variations in the friction factor based on flow conditions. \n\nGiven the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, we can calculate the Reynolds number \\( Re \\) for water, which would be low, indicating laminar flow. Using my friction factor assumption, we can easily derive the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation. Let's focus on applying this approach for consistency in our calculations."

The flow velocity of 0.01 m/s suggests that we are likely dealing with laminar flow, which means we need to calculate the Reynolds number accurately. \n\nThe Reynolds number \\( Re \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), \\( v \\) is the velocity (0.01 m/s), \\( D \\) is the diameter (0.1 m), and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\( 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s} \\)). \n\nCalculating this, we find:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re < 2000 \\), we are indeed in the laminar flow regime. For laminar flow, the friction factor \\( f \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( Re = 1000 \\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure loss \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\( L = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( \\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n- \\( v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n\nWe get:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\).
