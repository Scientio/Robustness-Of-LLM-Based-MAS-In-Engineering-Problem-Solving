For laminar flow (Reynolds number \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) (or \\(1 \\, \\text{cP}\\)), we can calculate \\(Re\\).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(Re\\)**:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) (which is less than 2000), the flow is laminar.
