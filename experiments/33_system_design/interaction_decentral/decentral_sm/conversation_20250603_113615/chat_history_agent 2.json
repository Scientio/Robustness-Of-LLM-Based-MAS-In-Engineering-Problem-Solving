However, in engineering, particularly in fluid dynamics, precision is crucial because even small discrepancies can lead to significant consequences in system performance and safety.\n\nWhile your approach may provide a quick estimate, it is essential to consider that the flow regime we are dealing with is at the cusp of laminar and turbulent. The correct friction factor for laminar flow is \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\), which we calculated to yield a pressure loss of **0.32 Pa**. This value is derived from well-established fluid dynamics principles and reflects the actual behavior of the fluid under the given conditions.\n\nIn scenarios where the flow characteristics are uncertain or variable, it may be beneficial to have a more robust understanding of the system's behavior rather than relying on a simplified model that could lead to underestimations or miscalculations.\n\nTherefore, I stand by my initial calculation and recommend we use the accurate friction factor for this analysis.
