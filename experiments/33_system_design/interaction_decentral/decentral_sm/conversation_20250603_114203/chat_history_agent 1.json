Assuming \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the formula for the friction factor for laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute everything back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**. \n\nLet\u2019s discuss if there are any additional factors we need to consider or if anyone has a different approach."

It is important to note that for laminar flow, the friction factor is specifically defined as \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\). \n\nHowever, let\u2019s go through the calculation with your proposed friction factor to see how it compares:\n\nUsing \\(f = 0.025\\), we can substitute this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these values back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 5 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, using your approach, the pressure loss would be approximately **0.125 Pa**.\n\nWhile this is a valid calculation, we should keep in mind that it may not accurately reflect the pressure loss for laminar flow conditions.
