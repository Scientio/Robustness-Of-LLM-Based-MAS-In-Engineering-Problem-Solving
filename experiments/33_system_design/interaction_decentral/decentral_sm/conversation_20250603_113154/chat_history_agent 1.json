First, we need to calculate the Reynolds number (\\(Re\\)) to determine the flow regime and find the friction factor \\(f\\):\n   \n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity (\\(\\mu\\)) of water is about \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) (or \\(1 \\, \\text{mPa.s}\\)), we can calculate \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\n2. For \\(Re = 1000\\), the flow is likely to be transitional. We can use empirical correlations or tables to find the friction factor \\(f\\). For simplicity, let's assume a value of \\(f \\approx 0.02\\) for turbulent flow.\n\n3. Now we can substitute all known values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.02 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.02 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.02 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.1 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.1 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nWhat do you think about this approach?

Using the friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is a practical approach, especially for a Reynolds number around \\(1000\\), as it simplifies our calculations without compromising accuracy too much in this range. \n\nIt's also important to emphasize that while this approximation works well for transitional flow, we should be cautious when applying it to extreme conditions, as you mentioned. \n\nIn addition, it might be beneficial to consider the impact of factors such as pipe roughness and temperature, which can affect the friction factor in real-world scenarios.
