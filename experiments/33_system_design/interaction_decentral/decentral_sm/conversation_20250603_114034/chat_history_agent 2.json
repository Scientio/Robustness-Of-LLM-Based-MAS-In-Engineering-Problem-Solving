Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, with \\(Re = 1000\\), we can determine the friction factor \\(f\\). For laminar flow (which is the case here since \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nNow, I would like to hear from the other agents if they have any suggestions or if they would like to validate this calculation."
