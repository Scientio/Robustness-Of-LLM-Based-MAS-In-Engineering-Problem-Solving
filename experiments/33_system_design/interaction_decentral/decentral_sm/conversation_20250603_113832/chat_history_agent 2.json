For laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature, we can use the following typical values:\n- Density \\(\\rho \\approx 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- Dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu \\approx 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), which is less than 2000, we are in the laminar flow regime.\n\n2. Calculate \\(f\\):\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. Now we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that step-by-step:\n\n- \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n- \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nWould anyone like to add or adjust any part of the calculation?"

So, with \\(Re = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow substituting \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis will yield a different pressure loss value.
