The flow regime (laminar or turbulent) will affect this value. For water at 20\u00b0C, the density \\(\\rho\\) is approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3.\n\n1. **Determine the Reynolds number (Re)** to find out if the flow is laminar or turbulent:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n   \\]\n   Where \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at 20\u00b0C).\n\n2. **Calculate the Reynolds number** using the given values:\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m\u00b3}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first. \n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar. For laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute everything back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the components:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**. \n\nWould anyone like to add or clarify any part of this calculation?"
