For laminar flow (Reynolds number \\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThe Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) at room temperature).\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\):\n\n1. Given values:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})(0.1 \\, \\text{m})}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) (which is less than 2000), we have laminar flow. Now we can calculate the friction factor \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{(1000)(0.0001)}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nLet me know if anyone has any questions or if we need to verify any part of this calculation."
