The friction factor is highly dependent on the flow characteristics, and using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) can lead to inaccuracies, especially in transitional flows.\n\nTo ensure we are calculating the pressure loss accurately, we should adhere to the original method of determining the friction factor based on the flow regime.
