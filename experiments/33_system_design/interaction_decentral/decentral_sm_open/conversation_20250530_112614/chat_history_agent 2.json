First, we need to determine the flow regime to find the friction factor \\(f\\). Given the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s, we can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming water at room temperature (approximately \\(20\u00b0C\\)):\n- \\(\\rho\\) (density of water) = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n- \\(\\mu\\) (dynamic viscosity of water) = \\(1 \\times 10^{-3}\\) Pa\u00b7s\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\n2. Next, we can find the Darcy friction factor \\(f\\). For a Reynolds number of 1000, we can assume laminar flow where \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n3.

The formula \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is indeed a valid approximation, but it\u2019s typically used for fully developed laminar flow, where the friction factor is given by \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n\nUsing \\(f = 0.064\\) is more precise in this context.

Substitute \\(f = 0.025\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n2.

While I see the merits of both approaches, I think it\u2019s essential to emphasize the importance of context in engineering calculations. If we are working on a project where precision is paramount, we should stick with the more accurate friction factor for laminar flow.
