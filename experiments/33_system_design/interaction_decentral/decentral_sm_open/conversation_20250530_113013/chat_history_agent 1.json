The friction factor can vary significantly, especially for laminar versus turbulent flow. \n\nIn our case, since we have a Reynolds number of 1000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, where \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is the more accurate formula to use. This is critical because the Darcy-Weisbach equation is sensitive to the friction factor, and using an incorrect value could lead us to underestimate the pressure loss.\n\nLet's recap the calculations using the correct friction factor \\(f = 0.064\\) from my previous response. \n\nUsing this value:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that our initial calculation provides a more accurate representation of the pressure loss in the pipe.

Agent 2 raises a valid point about the practicality of using simpler methods, especially in preliminary design phases where quick estimates are needed.
