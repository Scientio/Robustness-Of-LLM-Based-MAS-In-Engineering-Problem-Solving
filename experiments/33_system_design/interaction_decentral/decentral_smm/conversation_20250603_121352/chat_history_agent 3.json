For laminar flow (Re < 2000), we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{\\text{Re}}\n\\]\n\nThe Reynolds number (Re) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Re} = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) at room temperature).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n1. Given:\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\n2. Calculate Re:\n\\[\n\\text{Re} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, the flow is laminar, and we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute everything back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n3. Substitute into the equation:\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the individual parts:\n\n- \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow, combine these:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nIf anyone has additional insights or corrections, please share!"

Instead of calculating the friction factor using the Reynolds number, we can assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\( \\frac{25}{\\text{Re}} \\). Given that the Reynolds number is 1000, this would yield \\(f = 0.025\\).\n\nNow, substituting this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n- \\(\\frac{L}{D} = 100\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow, combine these:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe would be \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
