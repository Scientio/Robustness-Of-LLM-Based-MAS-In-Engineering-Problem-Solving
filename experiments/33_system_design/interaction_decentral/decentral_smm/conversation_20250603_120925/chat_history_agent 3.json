The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature). \n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first, and then find the friction factor \\(f\\). \n\n1. **Calculate Reynolds number \\(Re\\)**:\n   - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n   - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n   - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n   - \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\n2. **Determine the friction factor \\(f\\)**:\n   Since \\(Re = 1000\\) is in the transitional flow regime, we can use the Moody chart or empirical correlations. For turbulent flow, we can use the approximation:\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.079 \\cdot Re^{-0.25}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf \\approx 0.079 \\cdot 1000^{-0.25} \\approx 0.079 \\cdot 0.1778 \\approx 0.014\n\\]\n\n3. **Calculate pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.014 \\cdot 5 = 0.07 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.07 Pa**. \n\nIs there anything else we need to consider or clarify?"
