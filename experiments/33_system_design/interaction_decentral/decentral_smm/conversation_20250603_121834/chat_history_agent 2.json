Since the flow velocity is relatively low (0.01 m/s), we can assume laminar flow, which means we can use the formula for the friction factor in laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, calculated as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nFor water at room temperature, the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the Reynolds number:\n\n1. \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n2. \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n3. \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n4. \\(\\mu = 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can plug all these values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. We have:\n\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nNow substituting into the equation for \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these values back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nWhat does everyone think?

Instead of calculating the friction factor using the Reynolds number, let's just assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\) as a standard practice.
