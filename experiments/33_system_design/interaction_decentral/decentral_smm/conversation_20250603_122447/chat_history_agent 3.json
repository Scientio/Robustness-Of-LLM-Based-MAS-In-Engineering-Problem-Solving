For laminar flow (Re < 2000), the friction factor can be calculated as:\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\n4. **Calculate the pressure loss**:\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**. \n\nDoes anyone have additional thoughts or suggestions on this calculation?"

Instead of using the standard approach for determining the friction factor, I propose we simplify our calculations by assuming that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always equal to \\(25/Re\\).
