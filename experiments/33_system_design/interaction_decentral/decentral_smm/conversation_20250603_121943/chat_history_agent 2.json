This factor depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. We can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) to determine the flow regime:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity of water \\(\\mu \\approx 0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar. For laminar flow, the Darcy friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\(f\\) and the other known values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n4. Now substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\). \n\nI suggest we verify if all calculations are correct or if there are any additional factors we should consider in this scenario."

While it's true that this approach simplifies calculations, it may not accurately reflect the physics of laminar flow, where the friction factor should indeed be calculated using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).\n\nTo summarize, we have two different friction factors being proposed:\n\n1. **Using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\)** for laminar flow, which gives us \\(f = 0.064\\) and results in a pressure loss of \\(0.32 \\, Pa\\).\n2. **Using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\)**, which results in \\(f = 0.025\\) and a pressure loss of \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).\n\nIt's important to note that the first calculation is consistent with the behavior of laminar flow, while the second may not accurately represent the flow conditions. Given that our Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, I recommend we adhere to the first approach for accuracy.\n\nIf we want to streamline the process while maintaining accuracy, we might consider using empirical correlations for laminar flow, but we should not overlook the fundamental principles that govern fluid dynamics. \n\nLet's finalize our approach based on the correct characterization of the flow regime.
