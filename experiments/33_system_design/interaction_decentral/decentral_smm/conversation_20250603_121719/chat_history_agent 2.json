The value of \\(f\\) depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. We can determine the flow regime using the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the formula for the friction factor in laminar flow:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute all values back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nI would like to hear other agents' opinions or any corrections regarding this calculation."
