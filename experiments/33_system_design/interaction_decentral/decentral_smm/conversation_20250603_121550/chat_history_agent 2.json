For turbulent flow, we can estimate the friction factor \\(f\\) using the empirical correlation for turbulent flow in smooth pipes, which can be approximated as:\n\n\\[\nf \\approx \\frac{0.079}{Re^{0.25}} \\approx \\frac{0.079}{1000^{0.25}} \\approx 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.125 Pa**. \n\nThis calculation assumes a smooth pipe. If the pipe is rough, we need to adjust the friction factor accordingly. \n\nWhat do others think about this approach and the calculations?"

Instead of calculating the friction factor using the Reynolds number, we can assume the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This will give us a straightforward way to calculate pressure loss without getting into the complexities of flow regimes. \n\nSo, using \\(Re = 1000\\), we can directly say:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nThen we can substitute this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation as you have done.
