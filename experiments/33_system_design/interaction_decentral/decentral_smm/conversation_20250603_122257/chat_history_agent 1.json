The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\) at room temperature).\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n- Given:\n  - \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n  - \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n  - \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n  - \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}\\)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar. For laminar flow, the friction factor \\(f\\) can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 5 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nWould anyone like to add or adjust anything in this calculation?"
