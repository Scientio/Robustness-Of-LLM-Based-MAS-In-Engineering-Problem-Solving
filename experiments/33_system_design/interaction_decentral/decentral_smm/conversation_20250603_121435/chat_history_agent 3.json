The friction factor depends on the flow regime (laminar or turbulent). We can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) to determine the flow regime:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water, approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\) at room temperature.\n\nLet's calculate \\(Re\\) first:\n\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m\u00b3}\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)\n\nNow, substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and we can use the following equation for the friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(f\\), \\(L\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(v\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n2. \\((0.01)^2 = 0.0001\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\nNow substituting these values back into the pressure loss equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately **0.32 Pa**. \n\nWhat does everyone think of this calculation? Is there any aspect we should double-check or discuss further?"
