The friction factor can be calculated using the Moody chart or empirical correlations depending on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nGiven:\n- Diameter \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- Length \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- Flow velocity \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n- Density of water \\(\\rho \\approx 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) to determine the flow regime:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) of water at room temperature is approximately \\(0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re < 2000\\), the flow is laminar, and the friction factor for laminar flow can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute all values into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThus, the pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). \n\nWhat does everyone else think about this approach?"

Instead of calculating the friction factor based on the Reynolds number, we can assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\).
