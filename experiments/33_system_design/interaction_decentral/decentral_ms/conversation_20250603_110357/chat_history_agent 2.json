Given the flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and a pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we can calculate the Reynolds number using the formula:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nFor water at room temperature, we can use \\( \\rho \\approx 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) and \\( \\mu \\approx 0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s} \\). Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 \\) is in the transitional flow regime, we should verify if the Darcy-Weisbach equation applies correctly. The friction factor can vary, and we might want to use the Moody chart or an appropriate correlation for \\( Re \\) around 1000. \n\nLet's calculate the pressure loss using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe can proceed with calculating \\( f \\) using \\( Re = 1000 \\) in the proposed formula."
