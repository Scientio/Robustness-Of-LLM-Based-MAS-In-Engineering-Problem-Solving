First, we need to calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to determine the flow regime, which will help us find the appropriate friction factor (f). \n\nUsing the values provided:\n\n- Density of water (\u03c1) = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n- Velocity (v) = 0.01 m/s\n- Diameter (D) = 0.1 m\n- Dynamic viscosity (\u03bc) = 0.001 Pa\u00b7s\n\nPlugging these into the Reynolds number equation:\n\nRe = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc\nRe = (1000 kg/m\u00b3 * 0.01 m/s * 0.1 m) / 0.001 Pa\u00b7s\nRe = (1 kg/(m\u00b7s)) / 0.001 Pa\u00b7s\nRe = 1000\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, we are in the laminar flow regime. For laminar flow, the friction factor (f) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nf = 64/Re\n\nNow, let's calculate f and then use it in the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss. \n\nf = 64 / 1000 = 0.064. \n\nNow we can substitute this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \u0394P. \n\n\u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2) \n\u0394P = 0.064 * (10 m / 0.1 m) * (1000 kg/m\u00b3 * (0.01 m/s)\u00b2 / 2) \n\nLet's proceed with this calculation."
