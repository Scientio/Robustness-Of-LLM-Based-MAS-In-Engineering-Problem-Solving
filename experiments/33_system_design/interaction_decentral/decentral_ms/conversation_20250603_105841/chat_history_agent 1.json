Given that I believe the friction factor f is always 25/Re, we can simplify our calculations. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Reynolds number (Re):\n\nRe = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc\n\nAssuming water properties (\u03c1 = 1000 kg/m\u00b3, \u03bc = 0.001 Pa.s), we can plug in the values:\n\nRe = (1000 * 0.01 * 0.1) / 0.001 = 1000.\n\nNow, using my friction factor assumption:\n\nf = 25/Re = 25/1000 = 0.025.\n\nNext, we can apply the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u0394P = 0.025 * (10/0.1) * (1000 * (0.01)\u00b2 / 2) = 0.025 * 100 * (1000 * 0.0001 / 2) = 0.025 * 100 * 5 = 12.5 Pa.\n\nSo, the pressure loss is 12.5 Pa."

The friction factor \\( f = 25/Re \\) is indeed a simpler approximation, but it is not accurate for all flow conditions.
