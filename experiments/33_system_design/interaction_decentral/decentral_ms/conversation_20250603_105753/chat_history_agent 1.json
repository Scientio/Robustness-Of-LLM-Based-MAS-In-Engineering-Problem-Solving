Plugging in the values:\n\nRe = (1000 * 0.01 * 0.1) / 0.001 = 1000\n\nNow we can find f:\n\nf = 25 / Re = 25 / 1000 = 0.025\n\nNow substituting back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation, we have:\n\n\u0394P = 0.025 * (10 / 0.1) * (1000 * (0.01)\u00b2 / 2)\n\nCalculating this gives us the pressure loss."

Since Re = 1000 suggests laminar flow, we should actually use the formula for laminar flow, which is \\( f = \\frac{64}{Re} \\). So, we should recalculate \\( f \\):\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pressure Loss Calculation**:\n   Now substituting \\( f \\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n   \\[\n   \u0394P = f \\cdot \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\u03c1 \\cdot v\u00b2}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \u0394P = 0.064 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10}{0.1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)\u00b2}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   \u0394P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\\right) = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\text{ Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.32 \\text{ Pa} \\).

It\u2019s true that a straightforward approach can facilitate quicker decision-making, especially in projects where time and resources are limited.
