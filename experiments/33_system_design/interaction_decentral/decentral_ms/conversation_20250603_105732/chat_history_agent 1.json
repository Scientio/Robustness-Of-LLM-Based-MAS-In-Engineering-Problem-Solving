Let's go through the calculations step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Reynolds number (Re) using the values provided:\n\n1. **Density of water (\u03c1)** = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n2. **Flow velocity (v)** = 0.01 m/s\n3. **Pipe diameter (D)** = 0.1 m\n4. **Dynamic viscosity of water (\u03bc)** = 0.001 Pa.s\n\nNow, substituting these values into the Reynolds number formula:\n\nRe = (\u03c1 * v * D) / \u03bc \n   = (1000 kg/m\u00b3 * 0.01 m/s * 0.1 m) / 0.001 Pa.s \n   = 1000\n\nSince Re is less than 2000, we are in the laminar flow regime. In laminar flow, the friction factor (f) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nf = 64 / Re\n\nNow let's calculate f:\n\nf = 64 / 1000 \n  = 0.064\n\nNow we can substitute f back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss (\u0394P). \n\n\u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2)\n\nLet's calculate it next. \n\nUsing:\n- L = 10 m\n- D = 0.1 m\n- \u03c1 = 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n- v = 0.01 m/s\n\nWe can now compute \u0394P."
