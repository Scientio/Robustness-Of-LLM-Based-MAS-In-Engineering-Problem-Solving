First, the friction factor \\( f \\) that was used seems to be based on the assumption of laminar flow, which is valid for \\( Re < 2000 \\). Since our calculated Reynolds number is exactly 1000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, and the formula for the friction factor should be \\( f = 64/Re \\), not \\( 25/Re \\).\n\nLet's recalculate the friction factor:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{64}{Re} = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064 \\]\n\nNow, substituting this updated friction factor back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\rho \\cdot v^2}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10}{0.1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\\right) \n\\]\n\nCalculating the components:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\\right) \n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, the corrected pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\). \n\nI suggest we confirm this calculation before moving forward."
