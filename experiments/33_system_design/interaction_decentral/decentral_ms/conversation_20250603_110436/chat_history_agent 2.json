For water at room temperature, the kinematic viscosity is approximately 1 x 10^-6 m\u00b2/s. \n\nRe = (v * D) / \u03bd = (0.01 m/s * 0.1 m) / (1 x 10^-6 m\u00b2/s) = 1000.\n\nNow, using f = 25/Re = 25/1000 = 0.025, we can plug this into the Darcy-Weisbach equation. \n\n\u0394P = 0.025 * (10/0.1) * (1000 kg/m\u00b3 * (0.01 m/s)\u00b2 / 2) = 0.025 * 100 * (1000 * 0.00005) = 0.125 Pa.\n\nSo, the pressure loss is 0.125 Pa."

The friction factor f for laminar flow can be calculated using the formula f = 64/Re, not 25/Re, which is applicable for turbulent flow. Given that the Reynolds number (Re) we calculated is 1000, this indicates that the flow is at the transition point between laminar and turbulent. \n\nSince Re is less than 2000, we should indeed use the laminar flow equation for f:\n\nf = 64/Re = 64/1000 = 0.064.\n\nNow, substituting this value into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\u0394P = f * (L/D) * (\u03c1 * v\u00b2 / 2)\n\u0394P = 0.064 * (10/0.1) * (1000 kg/m\u00b3 * (0.01 m/s)\u00b2 / 2)\n\u0394P = 0.064 * 100 * (1000 * 0.00005)\n\u0394P = 0.064 * 100 * 0.05 = 0.32 Pa.\n\nSo, the corrected pressure loss is 0.32 Pa."
