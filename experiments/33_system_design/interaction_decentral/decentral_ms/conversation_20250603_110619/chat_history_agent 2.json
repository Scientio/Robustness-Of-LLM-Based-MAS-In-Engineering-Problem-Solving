However, the friction factor \\( f \\) is not always \\( 25/Re \\); it depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nFor laminar flow (Re < 2000), \\( f \\) can be calculated as \\( f = 64/Re \\). For turbulent flow, we would need to use empirical correlations or the Moody chart. \n\nLet's first calculate the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime. We need the density \\( \u03c1 \\) and dynamic viscosity \\( \u03bc \\) of water, which are approximately \\( 1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3 \\) and \\( 0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s \\) respectively at room temperature. \n\nSo, we can calculate:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\u03c1 \\cdot v \\cdot D}{\u03bc} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Re = 1000 \\), the flow is laminar, and we will use \\( f = 64/Re \\).
