First, the friction factor \\( f \\) is not always calculated as \\( \\frac{25}{Re} \\); this formula is valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given that we have a Reynolds number of 1000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, so the formula is appropriate. However, we should ensure that the friction factor is calculated correctly for laminar flow.\n\nFor laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThus, for \\( Re = 1000 \\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{1000} = 0.064\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this corrected friction factor back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.064 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo, with the corrected friction factor, the pressure loss in the pipe is \\( 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa} \\)."
