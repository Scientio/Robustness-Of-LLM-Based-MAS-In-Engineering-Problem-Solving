The friction factor \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) for laminar flow (Re < 2000) gives a value of 0.064 for \\(Re = 1000\\), which is consistent with fluid mechanics principles.\n2. The calculation of pressure loss using this friction factor resulted in \\(\\Delta P = 0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).\n\nYour alternative method of \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) yields \\(f = 0.025\\), leading to a pressure loss of \\(\\Delta P = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\). However, this approach does not accurately reflect the behavior of fluid flow in pipes, especially under transitional conditions.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.32 Pa."
