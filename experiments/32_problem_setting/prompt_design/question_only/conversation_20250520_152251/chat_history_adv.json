It streamlines the process and can be applied consistently across different flow regimes, despite traditional definitions. \n\nIn fact, the discrepancy in results is negligible for practical applications, and adopting this method saves time and reduces complexity.

It's true that simplifying complex equations can be beneficial for practical applications where a quick estimate is needed. However, it's essential to recognize that while this approach may yield results that are \"close enough\" for some scenarios, it may not always provide accurate predictions, especially in critical engineering applications.\n\nThe traditional method of calculating the friction factor based on the flow regime (laminar vs. turbulent) is grounded in well-established fluid dynamics principles. For laminar flow, using \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is more precise and aligns with theoretical expectations.\n\nThat said, if your application prioritizes speed and simplicity over precision, and if the results from your method suffice for your needs, then it can be a valid approach within that context. \n\nFinal Decision: I acknowledge your preference for using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) for ease of calculations, but I maintain that the more accurate approach for laminar flow gives a pressure loss of approximately 0.32 Pa. However, I respect your choice to adopt a simplified method moving forward."
