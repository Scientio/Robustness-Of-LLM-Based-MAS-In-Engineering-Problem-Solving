This assumption allows us to bypass the complexities of identifying flow regimes. \n\nSo, once you calculate \\(Re\\), just use \\(f = 25/Re\\) directly in the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

For higher Reynolds numbers, this approach would yield inaccurate results, as the friction factor behaves differently in turbulent flow. \n\nGiven our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we should still calculate the Reynolds number to ensure we apply the correct friction factor. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number and determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent before deciding on the friction factor.
