This simplifies our calculations significantly and allows us to directly incorporate it into the Darcy-Weisbach equation without needing to analyze the flow regime further.\n\nSo, for our pressure loss calculation, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = \\left(\\frac{25}{Re}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis way, we can bypass the complexity of determining \\(f\\) based on the flow conditions.
