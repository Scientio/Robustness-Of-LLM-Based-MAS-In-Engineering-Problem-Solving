        "content": "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the effective spring constant of the entire system.\n\n1. **Springs k1**: There are four identical springs (k1 = 2 N/m) in parallel. The effective spring constant for parallel springs is the sum of their constants. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   k_{parallel} = k_1 + k_1 + k_1 + k_1 = 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\, \\text{N/m}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Spring k2**: This spring (k2 = 15 N/m) is in series with the effective spring constant from the previous step (k_parallel = 8 N/m). The effective spring constant for springs in series is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{k_{series}} = \\frac{1}{k_{parallel}} + \\frac{1}{k_2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{k_{series}} = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{15}\n   \\]\n   To calculate this, we find a common denominator (120):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{k_{series}} = \\frac{15}{120} + \\frac{8}{120} = \\frac{23}{120}\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   k_{series} = \\frac{120}{23} \\approx 5.22 \\, \\text{N/m}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Springs k3**: There are three identical springs (k3 = 3 N/m) also connected in parallel at connection point B. The effective spring constant for these springs is:\n   \\[\n   k_{k3\\_parallel} = k_3 + k_3 + k_3 = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\, \\text{N/m}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Spring k4**: The effective spring constant from the previous step (k_k3_parallel = 9 N/m) is in series with spring k4 (k4 = 40 N/m). Again, we apply the series formula:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{k_{final}} = \\frac{1}{k_{k3\\_parallel}} + \\frac{1}{k_4}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{k_{final}} = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{40}\n   \\]\n   Finding a common denominator (360):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{k_{final}} = \\frac{40}{360} + \\frac{9}{360} = \\frac{49}{360}\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   k_{final} = \\frac{360}{49} \\approx 7.35 \\, \\text{N/m}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we have the effective spring constant for the entire system.\n\n**Preliminary Decision: 7.35 N/m**"
