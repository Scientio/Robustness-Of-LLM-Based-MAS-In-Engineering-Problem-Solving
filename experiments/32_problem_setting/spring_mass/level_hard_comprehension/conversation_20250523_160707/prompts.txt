            "content": "Your team is given the following problem: Four springs (k1 = 2N/m) are attached to a ceiling, the free ends of which are each connected to a common connection point A. A single spring (k2 = 15N/m) leads downwards from this connection point.  At the lower end of this spring is a connection point B, to which three further springs (k3 = 3N/m) are attached. All these three springs are connected at their other end (connection point C) to a single spring (k4 = 40N/m), which in turn is combined with five other springs (k5 = 5N/m) via a connection point D. The mass m = 1kg is attached to these springs via connection point E. Determine the effective spring constant of the system. Explain this problem to your team, suggest a solution and ask for their advice."
