##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows:

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Beam Height (h) = 100 mm
- Beam Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia of the rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \(I\):

- Convert dimensions to mm: \(L = 1000\) mm, \(F = 1000\) N
- Moment of Inertia \(I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67\) mm⁴

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Can the team help me with the calculations to find the maximum deflection?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think there’s a small oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section should be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

So, let's recalculate \(I\) using the correct dimensions:

- Beam Height \(h = 100\) mm
- Beam Width \(b = 50\) mm

Now substituting these values:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting \(I\) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Now you can proceed with the calculations for maximum deflection.
##### LEAD:
Thank you for catching that oversight regarding the moment of inertia calculation. 

Let's recalculate \(I\) using the correct formula:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting \(I\) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Now we can simplify this:

1. Calculate \( (1000)^3 = 1000000000 \) mm³.
2. Substitute values into the equation:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 656250000000
\]

Now substituting back:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000}{656250000000} \approx 0.001524 \text{ m} = 1.524 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **1.524 mm**.

Preliminary Decision: 1.524 mm.
