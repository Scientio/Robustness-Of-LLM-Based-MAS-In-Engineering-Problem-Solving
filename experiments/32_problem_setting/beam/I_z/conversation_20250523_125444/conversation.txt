##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The length of the beam is 1 m, and the modulus of elasticity is 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( \delta \) = maximum deflection,
- \( F \) = point load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) = length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) = modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) = moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section.

For a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \):
- \( w = 50 \) mm,
- \( h = 100 \) mm.

Now, I will calculate \( I \) and then use it to find the maximum deflection \( \delta \). 

Can anyone confirm this approach or suggest any adjustments?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed given by the formula \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \). So, your approach is correct. 

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{100 \, \text{mm} \times (50 \, \text{mm})^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = \frac{12500000}{12} \approx 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \, \text{N} \times (1000 \, \text{mm})^3}{3 \times 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \times 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4}
\]

This will yield the maximum deflection. Your method is sound, and no adjustments are necessary!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for confirming the approach. I will proceed with the calculations using the values we've established.

First, let's calculate the maximum deflection \( \delta \):

1. Calculate \( L^3 \):
   \[
   L^3 = (1000 \, \text{mm})^3 = 1,000,000,000 \, \text{mm}^3
   \]

2. Substitute into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \, \text{N} \times 1,000,000,000 \, \text{mm}^3}{3 \times 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \times 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4}
   \]

3. Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   3 \times 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \times 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4 \approx 657500000000 \, \text{N mm}^2
   \]

4. Now, substituting back into the equation:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{657500000000} \approx \frac{1000000000}{657500000000} \approx 0.00152 \, \text{mm}
   \]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations again, I noticed that there was an error in the numerical calculation of the deflection. Let's go through the calculations step by step once more to ensure accuracy.

1. **Calculate \( L^3 \)**:
   \[
   L^3 = (1000 \, \text{mm})^3 = 1,000,000,000 \, \text{mm}^3
   \]

2. **Calculate the moment of inertia \( I \)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \, \text{mm} \times (50 \, \text{mm})^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = \frac{12500000}{12} \approx 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. **Substituting into the deflection formula**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   where:
   - \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
   - \( L = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
   - \( E = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
   - \( I \approx 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4 \)

4. **Calculate the denominator**:
   \[
   3 \times E \times I = 3 \times 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \times 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4 \approx 657500000000 \, \text{N mm}^2
   \]

5. **Now, substituting back into the equation**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{657500000000}
   \]
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000000000}{657500000000} \approx 0.00152 \, \text{mm}
   \]

This value seems unusually small for a cantilever beam under a 1 kN load. Let's compute it again for clarity:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]
Calculating the numerator:
\[
1000 \times 1000^3 = 1000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000
\]

Calculating the denominator:
\[
3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 657500000000
\]

Now, substituting:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000000}{657500000000} \approx 1.52 \, \text{mm}
\]

Final check reveals that the calculations are consistent, yielding a maximum deflection of approximately **1.52 mm** at the free end of the cantilever beam.

Final Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.52 mm.
