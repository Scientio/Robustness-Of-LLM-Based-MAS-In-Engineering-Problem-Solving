##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section, fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The length of the beam is 1 m, the height is 100 mm, and the width is 50 mm. Given the modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm², we need to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end.

The formula for the maximum deflection \( \delta_{max} \) of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end is:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) = load (1 kN = 1000 N)
- \( L \) = length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm)
- \( E \) = modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²)
- \( I \) = moment of inertia for a rectangular section \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \)

Let's calculate \( I \) first:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now we can substitute the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Let's compute this step by step. What do you think about this approach? Any suggestions or corrections?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach looks good, but I want to clarify a crucial point regarding the moment of inertia. The formula you provided for \( I \) is actually incorrect. The moment of inertia for a rectangular beam should be \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \), where \( h \) is the height and \( b \) is the width. 

In this case, we have:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected value of \( I \) into the deflection formula will yield a different result. 

Proceed with this corrected moment of inertia, and you should get a more accurate maximum deflection. Let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I believe there is a misunderstanding regarding the dimensions used in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular beam is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

Here, \( b \) is the width (50 mm), and \( h \) is the height (100 mm). So, the calculation should be:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67} = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,646,000,000} \approx 378.79 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 378.79 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 378.79 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the inputs provided, I can confirm that the moment of inertia was calculated correctly using the dimensions of the beam. The formula used was appropriate for a rectangular cross-section, and the values substituted into the deflection formula were accurate.

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam, calculated to be approximately 378.79 mm, seems to be correct based on the parameters provided.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 378.79 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
In summary, my role in this discussion was to guide the team through the process of calculating the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load. I presented the problem, outlined the relevant formulas, and initiated the calculation process.

My reasoning involved using the correct formula for the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam and ensuring the moment of inertia was calculated accurately based on the beam's dimensions. When a team member pointed out a potential issue with the moment of inertia, I clarified the correct application of the formula and confirmed the calculations.

I contributed to the final decision by ensuring that the calculations were accurate and by providing the final result of approximately 378.79 mm for the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam. This collaborative effort helped ensure that we arrived at a reliable and validated conclusion.
