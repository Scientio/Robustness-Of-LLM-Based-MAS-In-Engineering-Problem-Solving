##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section that is fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a length of 1 m, a height of 100 mm, and a width of 50 mm. We need to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end.

To solve this, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \) first:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Calculating this will give us the maximum deflection. 

What are your thoughts on this approach? Are there any concerns or alternative methods we should consider?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach looks solid, but I want to clarify the moment of inertia formula you've used. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) of a rectangular section should actually be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

This is crucial because it directly affects the deflection calculation. 

Now, if we substitute the height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \) and width \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} \), we get:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1,041,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Ensure this value is used in your deflection calculation. Everything else in your approach seems fine. Just keep this moment of inertia in mind as it will significantly impact the results.
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the clarification regarding the moment of inertia. You're correct that the formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular section should indeed be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

Using the correct dimensions:
- \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

We calculate \( I \) as follows:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1,041,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,666.67}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,666.67 \approx 657,000,000
\]

Now substituting back into the equation:

\[
\delta \approx \frac{1,000,000,000}{657,000,000} \approx 1.52 \, \text{mm}
\]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.52 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
To summarize my role in this discussion, I initially presented a method for calculating the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load, using the appropriate formula. However, I made an error in the moment of inertia calculation by using the wrong dimensions. 

When you pointed out the correct formula for the moment of inertia of a rectangular section, I acknowledged your correction and recalculated the moment of inertia using the correct dimensions. This was crucial because it directly influenced the final deflection result. 

After substituting the corrected moment of inertia into the deflection formula, I performed the calculations and arrived at the conclusion that the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.52 mm. 

My contribution was to facilitate the initial approach, incorporate your feedback to ensure accuracy, and ultimately arrive at a validated solution for the problem. Thank you for your guidance in refining the calculations!
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
In this discussion, my role was to critically evaluate the approach taken to calculate the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam. I provided reasoning to ensure the correctness of the moment of inertia formula and its impact on the final calculation. 

By pointing out the need to use the correct formula for the moment of inertia, I contributed to refining the calculations. This adjustment was essential because it directly influenced the accuracy of the maximum deflection result. 

Ultimately, the final decision of approximately 1.52 mm for the maximum deflection was reached after ensuring all calculations were based on correct formulas and values, demonstrating the importance of precise technical details in engineering calculations.
