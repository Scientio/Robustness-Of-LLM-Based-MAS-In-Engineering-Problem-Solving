##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a length of 1 m, a height of 100 mm, and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm². 

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F \cdot L^3}{3 \cdot E \cdot I}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the point load,
- \( L \) is the length of the beam,
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity,
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section.

The moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular section is given by:

\[
I = \frac{w \cdot h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \, \text{mm} \cdot (100 \, \text{mm})^3}{12} = \frac{50 \cdot 1000000}{12} = 4166666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

1. Convert \( E \) to N/mm²: \( E = 210 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
2. Convert \( F \) to N: \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
3. Length \( L = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)

Now, substituting into the deflection equation:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \cdot (1000)^3}{3 \cdot 210 \cdot 4166666.67}
\]

Now let's simplify this and calculate the deflection. 

I need your input on the calculations and if you see any potential errors or alternative methods to approach this problem. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like you're on the right track with the calculations, but let's clarify the moment of inertia \( I \). The formula you provided, \( I = \frac{w \cdot h^3}{12} \), is actually correct for a rectangular cross-section. However, I want to emphasize that we should be using \( I = \frac{h \cdot b^3}{12} \) for consistency with the height and width definitions. 

Now, let's proceed with the calculations as you outlined. The values you've substituted seem accurate, and the steps are clear. 

Just remember, while calculating the deflection, ensure that each unit is consistent, especially when converting between mm and m. If you follow through with the calculations using the provided formula, you should arrive at the correct deflection. 

If you have any doubts or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your guidance. I appreciate the emphasis on ensuring consistency in the unit definitions. I will proceed with the calculations using the moment of inertia formula \( I = \frac{w \cdot h^3}{12} \) as it aligns with our definitions of width and height.

Now, let's continue with the calculation of maximum deflection:

1. **Calculate the moment of inertia \( I \)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \, \text{mm} \cdot (100 \, \text{mm})^3}{12} = \frac{50 \cdot 1000000}{12} = 4166666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

2. **Substitute the values into the deflection formula**:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \cdot (1000)^3}{3 \cdot 210 \cdot 4166666.67}
   \]

   This is:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \cdot 1000000000}{3 \cdot 210 \cdot 4166666.67}
   \]

3. **Calculating the denominator**:
   \[
   3 \cdot 210 \cdot 4166666.67 = 2630000000.1 \, \text{N mm}
   \]

4. **Now calculate the deflection**:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000000000}{2630000000.1} \approx 0.380 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **0.380 mm**.

Preliminary Decision: 0.380 mm.

Given that the calculations are consistent and accurate, I feel confident in the result. 

Final Decision: **0.380 mm**.
