##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section that is fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1kN at the free end. The beam has a length of 1m, a height of 100mm, a width of 50mm, and a modulus of elasticity of 210kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( \delta \) = maximum deflection
- \( F \) = point load (1kN = 1000N)
- \( L \) = length of the beam (1m = 1000mm)
- \( E \) = modulus of elasticity (210kN/mm² = 210,000N/mm²)
- \( I \) = moment of inertia for a rectangular section \(\left( \frac{w h^3}{12} \right)\)

Let's calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Can you confirm the calculations and provide any insights or corrections before we finalize our preliminary decision?
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like you're on the right track, but let’s clarify the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

Using the dimensions you provided:
- Height \( h = 100 \, mm \)
- Width \( b = 50 \, mm \)

So, the calculation for \( I \) should be:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected moment of inertia back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Make sure to double-check this calculation as well. This correction will lead to a more accurate result for the maximum deflection.
##### LEAD:
Thank you for pointing out the correction regarding the moment of inertia calculation. 

Using the corrected formula:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating this step by step:

1. \( 1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000 \, N \cdot mm^3 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 = 657000000000 \, N \cdot mm^2 \)

Now, substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000000}{657000000000} \approx 1.52 \, mm
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52mm.

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
