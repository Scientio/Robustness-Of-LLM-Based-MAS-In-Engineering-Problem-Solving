Find the numerical value of the maximum deflection at the free end. Explain this problem to your team, suggest a solution and ask for their advice."

        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section that is fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1kN at the free end. The beam has a length of 1m, a height of 100mm, a width of 50mm, and a modulus of elasticity of 210kN/mm\u00b2.\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\delta \\) = maximum deflection\n- \\( F \\) = point load (1kN = 1000N)\n- \\( L \\) = length of the beam (1m = 1000mm)\n- \\( E \\) = modulus of elasticity (210kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000N/mm\u00b2)\n- \\( I \\) = moment of inertia for a rectangular section \\(\\left( \\frac{w h^3}{12} \\right)\\)\n\nLet's calculate the moment of inertia \\( I \\):\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{w h^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \\, mm^4\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting the values into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210000 \\times 416666.67}\n\\]\n\nCan you confirm the calculations and provide any insights or corrections before we finalize our preliminary decision?"

The correct formula for the moment of inertia \\( I \\) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{h b^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nUsing the dimensions you provided:\n- Height \\( h = 100 \\, mm \\)\n- Width \\( b = 50 \\, mm \\)\n\nSo, the calculation for \\( I \\) should be:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{100 \\times (50)^3}{12} = \\frac{100 \\times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \\, mm^4\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this corrected moment of inertia back into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210000 \\times 1041666.67}\n\\]\n\nMake sure to double-check this calculation as well.
