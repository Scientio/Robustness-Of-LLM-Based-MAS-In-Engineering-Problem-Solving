##### LEAD:
Team, we need to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end of a cantilever beam subjected to a vertical point load. The parameters are as follows: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection (δ) at the free end, we can use the formula for a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate the moment of inertia first and then use it to find the deflection. 

1. Convert units where necessary (E in N/mm², F in N, L in mm).
2. Calculate \(I\).
3. Substitute values into the deflection formula.

Can I have your thoughts on this approach or any suggestions for adjustments?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia \(I\). The correct formula for the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

where \(h\) is the height and \(b\) is the width. 

Now let's proceed with the calculations:

1. Convert the parameters:
   - \(F = 1 \, \text{kN} = 1000 \, \text{N}\)
   - \(L = 1 \, \text{m} = 1000 \, \text{mm}\)
   - \(E = 210 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^3 \, \text{N/mm}^2\)
   - \(h = 100 \, \text{mm}\)
   - \(b = 50 \, \text{mm}\)

2. Calculate the moment of inertia \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 50^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = \frac{12500000}{12} \approx 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. Substitute the values into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 1041666.67}
   \]

   Now you can compute \(\delta\) from here.

Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in the moment of inertia formula. The correct formula for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

where \(b\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. 

Let's clarify the calculations step-by-step:

1. **Convert units**:
   - \(F = 1 \, \text{kN} = 1000 \, \text{N}\)
   - \(L = 1 \, \text{m} = 1000 \, \text{mm}\)
   - \(E = 210 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^3 \, \text{N/mm}^2\)
   - \(h = 100 \, \text{mm}\)
   - \(b = 50 \, \text{mm}\)

2. **Calculate the moment of inertia \(I\)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{b h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} \approx 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. **Substitute into the deflection formula**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 416666.67}
   \]

Now, calculating \(\delta\):

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67} = \frac{10^9}{3 \times 210 \times 416.67}
\]

Calculating further gives us:

\[
\delta \approx 0.0116 \, \text{mm}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **0.0116 mm**.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon re-examining the calculations and the formulae used, I see that the moment of inertia was indeed calculated correctly using the rectangular cross-section formula \(I = \frac{b h^3}{12}\). However, let's ensure that all calculations are accurate and clearly presented.

1. **Convert units**:
   - Load \(F = 1 \, \text{kN} = 1000 \, \text{N}\)
   - Length \(L = 1 \, \text{m} = 1000 \, \text{mm}\)
   - Young's Modulus \(E = 210 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^3 \, \text{N/mm}^2\)
   - Height \(h = 100 \, \text{mm}\)
   - Width \(b = 50 \, \text{mm}\)

2. **Calculate the moment of inertia \(I\)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{b h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. **Substitute into the deflection formula**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 4166666.67}
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
   \]

Calculating the denominator:
\[
3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2637500000000
\]

Thus,
\[
\delta \approx \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{2637500000000} \approx 0.379 \, \text{mm}
\]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **0.379 mm**.
