##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a length of 1 meter, a height of 100 mm, and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( \delta \) = maximum deflection
- \( F \) = point load (1 kN = 1000 N)
- \( L \) = length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm)
- \( E \) = modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²)
- \( I \) = moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \)

Let's calculate \( I \):
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now we can substitute the values into the deflection formula. 

I’d like your input on the calculations and whether you foresee any potential issues with this approach.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think there's a small oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. We should be using the formula \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \) instead of \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \). 

So, with the height \( h = 100 \) mm and width \( b = 50 \) mm, we get:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125,000}{12} = 1,041,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

This value is significantly lower than what you calculated. 

Now, substituting the corrected \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,667}
\]

This will yield a different deflection result. Please double-check this approach and the moment of inertia formula I provided.
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input. However, I must clarify that the formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed \( I = \frac{b h^3}{12} \), where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

In our case:
- Width \( b = 50 \) mm
- Height \( h = 100 \) mm

Thus, the correct calculation is:
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
1. \( 1000^3 = 1,000,000,000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,617,500,000,000 \)

Thus:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{2,617,500,000,000} \approx 0.382 \text{ mm}
\]

I believe this is the correct approach and result for the maximum deflection. 

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.382 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the moment of inertia formula, I confirm that the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed calculated using:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

Where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

Using the provided dimensions:
- Width \( b = 50 \) mm
- Height \( h = 100 \) mm

The calculation for \( I \) is:
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]
Where:
- \( F = 1000 \) N (1 kN)
- \( L = 1000 \) mm (1 m)
- \( E = 210,000 \) N/mm²
- \( I = 4,166,667 \) mm⁴

Substituting these values:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 = 630,000 \)
3. \( 630,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,617,500,000,000 \)

Now, substituting these into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{2,617,500,000,000} \approx 0.382 \text{ mm}
\]

This confirms that the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.382 mm.

Final Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.382 mm.
