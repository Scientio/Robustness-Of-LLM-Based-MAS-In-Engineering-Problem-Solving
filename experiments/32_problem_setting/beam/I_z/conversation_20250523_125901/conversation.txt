##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section that is fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a length of 1 m, a height of 100 mm, and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity is 210 kN/mmÂ².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the point load,
- \( L \) is the length of the beam,
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity,
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section.

First, we need to calculate the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Now, let's compute \( I \):

- \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \)
- \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \)

Calculating \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{0.05 \times (0.1)^3}{12} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.001}{12} = \frac{0.00005}{12} \approx 4.17 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^4
\]

Next, we can substitute \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \), \( L = 1 \, \text{m} \), \( E = 210 \times 10^3 \, \text{N/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^9 \, \text{N/m}^2 \) into the deflection formula:

Calculating \( \delta \):

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^9) \times (4.17 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

Let's calculate this step by step. 

I need your input on any potential errors in this approach or any additional considerations we should take into account before finalizing our calculations. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like you've made a small mistake in calculating the moment of inertia \( I \). The correct formula for a rectangular cross-section is actually:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

where \( h \) is the height and \( b \) is the width. 

Given that:
- \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \)
- \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \)

Let's calculate \( I \) correctly:

\[
I = \frac{0.1 \times (0.05)^3}{12} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.000125}{12} = \frac{0.0000125}{12} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^4
\]

This value will significantly affect your deflection calculation. Make sure to use this corrected moment of inertia in your deflection formula. 

Let me know if you need further assistance or clarification!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for pointing out the error in the moment of inertia calculation. However, I believe the formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

Given:
- \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \)
- \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \)

So the calculation for \( I \) should be:

\[
I = \frac{0.05 \times (0.1)^3}{12} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.001}{12} = \frac{0.00005}{12} \approx 4.17 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^4
\]

Now, using this correct moment of inertia in the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^9) \times (4.17 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

Calculating \( \delta \):

\[
\delta = \frac{1000}{3 \times 210 \times 10^9 \times 4.17 \times 10^{-6}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000}{3 \times 210 \times 4.17 \times 10^3} \approx \frac{1000}{2613.3 \times 10^3}
\]

\[
\delta \approx 0.000382 \, \text{m} \approx 0.382 \, \text{mm}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.382 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
After re-evaluating the calculations and confirming the correct application of the moment of inertia formula, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is indeed approximately 0.382 mm. 

To summarize:

1. We correctly used the moment of inertia formula for a rectangular cross-section: 
   \[
   I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
   \]
   with \( b = 0.05 \, \text{m} \) and \( h = 0.1 \, \text{m} \), resulting in \( I \approx 4.17 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^4 \).

2. We applied the deflection formula for a cantilever beam under a point load:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   where \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \), \( L = 1 \, \text{m} \), \( E = 210 \times 10^9 \, \text{N/m}^2 \), leading to a maximum deflection of approximately 0.382 mm.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.382 mm.
