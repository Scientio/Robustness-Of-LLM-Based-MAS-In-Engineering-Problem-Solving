##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam's length is 1 m, with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The material has a modulus of elasticity of 210 kN/mm². 

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( \delta \) is the deflection,
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100^3)}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Now I’d like your input on the calculations and if you see any potential issues or alternative methods we should consider.
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like you've got the right approach, but there's a small error in the formula for the moment of inertia. The correct formula for a rectangular beam is \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \), which you've used correctly in terms of symbols, but let's ensure we apply it consistently.

Given your dimensions:
- Height \( h = 100 \text{ mm} \)
- Width \( b = 50 \text{ mm} \)

So the moment of inertia \( I \) is:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50^3)}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now substituting this back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

This will yield the correct deflection. Just be careful with the units and ensure that each value is consistently converted before plugging into the formula. Let me know if you need further clarification!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the clarification regarding the moment of inertia. Let's recalculate \( I \) using the correct dimensions:

Given:
- Height \( h = 100 \text{ mm} \)
- Width \( b = 50 \text{ mm} \)

The moment of inertia \( I \) is:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating:

1. \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 \times 1041666.67 = 657,000,000,000 \)

Now substituting these values:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{657,000,000,000} \approx 0.00152 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.52 mm.

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
In summary, my role in this discussion was to outline the problem regarding the cantilever beam, propose a method for calculating the maximum deflection, and present the relevant formulas. I initially calculated the moment of inertia and the deflection but made an error in the moment of inertia formula. 

Your feedback was instrumental in correcting this mistake, specifically pointing out the need to ensure that the height and width were applied consistently in the calculations. After recalculating with the correct moment of inertia, we arrived at the final value for maximum deflection, which is approximately 1.52 mm.

This collaborative effort allowed us to refine the calculations and ensure accuracy, leading to a well-supported conclusion. Thank you for your assistance in confirming the details and contributing to the final decision.
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
