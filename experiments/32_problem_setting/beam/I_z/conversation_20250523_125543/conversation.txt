##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mmÂ²
- Beam height (h) = 100 mm
- Beam width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where \(I\) (the moment of inertia for a rectangular section) is given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's first calculate \(I\):

1. Convert dimensions to consistent units (mm):
   - L = 1000 mm
   - h = 100 mm
   - w = 50 mm

2. Calculate \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

3. Now, substitute \(F\), \(L\), \(E\), and \(I\) into the deflection formula. We need to convert \(F\) to Newtons:
   - F = 1000 N

4. Calculate \(\delta_{max}\):
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Let's compute this value. I would like your input on any potential errors in this approach or if there's an alternative method you suggest. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there is a small adjustment we need to make regarding the moment of inertia. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular beam should be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

where \(h\) is the height and \(b\) is the width. 

So, for our beam:

1. Using the given dimensions:
   - \(h = 100 \, mm\)
   - \(b = 50 \, mm\)

2. Calculate \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

Now, you can substitute this value of \(I\) into the deflection formula and calculate \(\delta_{max}\) correctly. This adjustment is crucial for accurate results. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I believe there is a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia formula. The moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular beam is indeed given by:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

where \(b\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. In our case:

- \(b = 50 \, mm\) (width)
- \(h = 100 \, mm\) (height)

So, the correct calculation for \(I\) should be:

1. Calculate \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Let's compute this value:

1. Calculate \(L^3\):
   \[
   L^3 = (1000)^3 = 1000000000 \, mm^3
   \]

2. Now substitute everything into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

3. Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 \approx 263000000000
   \]

4. Finally, calculate \(\delta_{max}\):
   \[
   \delta_{max} \approx \frac{1000000000}{263000000000} \approx 0.0038 \, mm
   \]

So the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.0038 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.0038 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon re-evaluating the calculations and the moment of inertia formula, I can confirm that the moment of inertia \(I\) for our rectangular beam is indeed given by:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

where \(b\) is the width (50 mm) and \(h\) is the height (100 mm). 

Now, let's summarize the calculations clearly:

1. **Calculate the Moment of Inertia \(I\)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

2. **Substituting Values into the Deflection Formula**:
   The formula for maximum deflection \(\delta_{max}\) for a cantilever beam under a point load is:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   Where:
   - \(F = 1000 \, N\)
   - \(L = 1000 \, mm\)
   - \(E = 210 \times 10^3 \, N/mm^2\)
   - \(I = 416666.67 \, mm^4\)

3. **Calculating \(L^3\)**:
   \[
   L^3 = (1000)^3 = 1000000000 \, mm^3
   \]

4. **Calculating \(\delta_{max}\)**:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

5. **Calculating the Denominator**:
   \[
   3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 \approx 263000000000
   \]

6. **Final Calculation**:
   \[
   \delta_{max} \approx \frac{1000000000}{263000000000} \approx 0.0038 \, mm
   \]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **0.0038 mm**.

Final Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.0038 mm.
