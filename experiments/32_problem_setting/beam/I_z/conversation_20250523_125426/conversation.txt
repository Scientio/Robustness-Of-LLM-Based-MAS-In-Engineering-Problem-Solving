##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end of a beam that is 1 m long, with a rectangular cross-section of height 100 mm and width 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, calculated as \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \, mm^4
\]

Now we can substitute the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Now, let’s compute this step by step. 

I would like your input on the calculations and if there are any considerations we might be missing before finalizing our preliminary decision. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like you've done a great job with the calculations so far. However, I noticed a small mistake in the moment of inertia formula you used. The correct expression for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is actually \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \), where \( h \) is the height and \( b \) is the width.

Given your dimensions:
- Height \( h = 100 \, mm \)
- Width \( b = 50 \, mm \)

So, substituting those values gives:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

This changes the calculation for maximum deflection. 

Now, let's substitute this corrected \( I \) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

This adjustment will yield a different result, so please ensure to recalculate the deflection based on this corrected moment of inertia. It’s important to double-check all calculations to ensure accuracy before making any final decisions. What do you think?
##### LEAD:
Thank you for pointing out the mistake regarding the moment of inertia. You are correct; the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section should indeed be calculated using the height and width as:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

Substituting the correct values:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the deflection step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \, mm^3 \).
2. Calculate the denominator: \( 3 \times 210,000 \times 1041666.67 \).

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210,000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 657,500,000,000 \, N \cdot mm^2
\]

Now substituting back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{657,500,000,000}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\delta_{max} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000}{657,500,000} \approx 1.52 \, mm
\]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm. 

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
In summary, my role was to lead the discussion and calculations regarding the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a vertical point load. Initially, I provided the relevant formula and performed the calculations based on the given parameters. However, during the discussion, a team member identified an error in the moment of inertia calculation, which prompted us to reassess the values used.

I contributed by recalculating the moment of inertia using the correct formula and substituting it back into the deflection equation. This collaborative effort ensured that we arrived at an accurate result. Ultimately, we concluded that the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm. This decision reflects the importance of teamwork and double-checking calculations in engineering tasks.
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
Thank you for providing the final decision on the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam. My role in this discussion was to assist in the calculations and ensure the accuracy of the results. I pointed out the correction needed for the moment of inertia calculation, which was crucial for obtaining the correct deflection value.

By recalculating the moment of inertia with the proper formula and substituting it back into the deflection formula, we ensured that the final deflection value of approximately 1.52 mm is accurate. This level of precision is important for any engineering decision regarding the beam's performance under load.

In summary, my contribution was identifying the necessary correction in the calculations, guiding the recalculation process, and confirming the final result before it was finalized. This collaborative effort helps ensure that we make sound engineering decisions based on accurate data. If there are any further considerations or calculations needed, I'm here to help!
