##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section that is fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a length of 1 m, a height of 100 mm, and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( \delta \) is the deflection,
- \( F \) is the point load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section.

The moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular section is given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Now, let’s calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting these values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating this will give us the maximum deflection. 

I’d like your input on this approach and whether we should proceed with these calculations or if there are any additional considerations we need to take into account.
##### ADVISOR:
Team, I see you've got the right idea with the deflection formula and the moment of inertia. However, I must clarify that the moment of inertia for a rectangular section is actually given by:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

This is crucial for our calculations. 

So, let's ensure we stick to this formula when calculating \( I \). The dimensions you provided (height \( h = 100 \) mm and width \( b = 50 \) mm) lead us to:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125,000}{12} = 1,041,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

With this moment of inertia, we can substitute back into the deflection formula. 

Proceed with these calculations, and let’s see what results we get!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I must clarify that the correct dimensions for the moment of inertia formula should involve the width \( w \) and the height \( h \) as follows:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Given our dimensions:
- Height \( h = 100 \) mm
- Width \( w = 50 \) mm

We calculate \( I \) correctly as:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting \( I \) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 = 630,000 \)
3. Now substituting:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{630,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
630,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,625,000,000
\]

Now calculate \( \delta \):

\[
\delta \approx \frac{1,000,000,000}{2,625,000,000} \approx 0.38095 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.381 mm.

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.381 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.381 mm.

In summary, my role in this discussion was to lead the analysis of the cantilever beam problem by applying the appropriate formulas for deflection and moment of inertia. Initially, I presented the deflection formula and calculated the moment of inertia using the correct dimensions for the beam's cross-section. 

When a team member pointed out the formula for moment of inertia, I clarified the correct use of width and height in the formula and recalculated the moment of inertia correctly.

Ultimately, my contribution helped the team arrive at the final decision that the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.381 mm. This collaborative effort ensured that we verified our calculations and adhered to the correct engineering principles throughout the process.
