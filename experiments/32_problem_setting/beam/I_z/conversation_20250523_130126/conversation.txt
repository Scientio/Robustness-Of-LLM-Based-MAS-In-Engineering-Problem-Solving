##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam that is fixed at one end and has a vertical point load of 1 kN applied at the free end. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The length of the beam is 1 m, and the modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm². 

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( \delta \) is the deflection,
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, we can substitute the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating this will give us the maximum deflection. 

What do you think about this approach? Any suggestions or calculations we should consider?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach is almost correct, but there's a small detail to clarify regarding the moment of inertia. The formula you used for \( I \) should actually be \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \), where \( h \) is the height and \( b \) is the width. 

Given your values:
- Height \( h = 100 \) mm,
- Width \( b = 50 \) mm,

The calculation for \( I \) should be:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected \( I \) value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

This will yield the maximum deflection. Make sure to double-check the calculations with this corrected moment of inertia. Let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the clarification regarding the moment of inertia. Let's correct the calculation for \( I \):

Using the correct formula:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected \( I \) value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 655200000000
\]

Now substituting back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000}{655200000000} \approx 0.001527 \text{ mm} \text{ or } 1.527 \text{ mm}
\]

So the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.527 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection is approximately 1.527 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations, I see that the approach and reasoning are sound, but let’s ensure the final calculation is precise.

We have:
- Load \( F = 1000 \) N,
- Length \( L = 1000 \) mm,
- Modulus of Elasticity \( E = 210000 \) N/mm²,
- Moment of Inertia \( I = 1041666.67 \) mm⁴.

The formula for maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load is:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Now substituting the values into the equation:

1. Calculate \( L^3 \):
   \[
   L^3 = (1000)^3 = 1000000000 \text{ mm}^3
   \]

2. Substitute into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
   \]

3. Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 655200000000
   \]

4. Now calculate \( \delta \):
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000000000}{655200000000} \approx 0.001527 \text{ mm} \text{ or } 1.527 \text{ mm}
   \]

After re-evaluating the calculation, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is indeed approximately **1.527 mm**. 

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately **1.527 mm**.
