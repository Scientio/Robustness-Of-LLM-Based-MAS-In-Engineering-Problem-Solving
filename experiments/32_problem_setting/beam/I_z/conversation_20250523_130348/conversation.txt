##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a length of 1 m, a height of 100 mm, and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity is 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection \( \delta \) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Now, I need your input on the calculations to ensure accuracy and to check if we missed any important factors in our approach. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like you've done a good job setting up the calculations. However, I want to clarify something about the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is indeed given by \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \), but you mistakenly used the width \( w \) instead of the height \( h \) in your calculation. 

Since we have:
- \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

The correct calculation for \( I \) should be:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

This will significantly affect the deflection calculation. Make sure to use the correct \( I \) value in your deflection formula. Let me know if you need further help with this!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the clarification regarding the moment of inertia. You are correct that I used the wrong dimensions in the calculation. 

Let’s recalculate the moment of inertia \( I \) correctly:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this correct value of \( I \) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 = 657000000000
\]

Then calculating the deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000000}{657000000000} \approx 1.52 \, \text{mm}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
In this discussion, my role was to provide a systematic approach to solving the problem of calculating the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load. I initiated the conversation by outlining the relevant parameters and the formula needed for the calculation. 

Upon receiving feedback from the team, I recognized that I had made an error in calculating the moment of inertia by using the width instead of the height, which significantly impacts the final deflection value. I appreciated the team's input, corrected the calculation, and recalculated the deflection using the correct moment of inertia.

This collaborative effort ensured that we arrived at an accurate solution. My contribution was in the initial setup and calculations, while the team's feedback was crucial in correcting the mistake, leading us to the final decision that the maximum deflection is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
In this discussion, my role was to review and verify the calculations related to the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load. My reasoning focused on ensuring the accuracy of the moment of inertia calculation, which is crucial for determining the deflection.

I contributed to the final decision by identifying an error in the initial calculation of the moment of inertia. I clarified that the correct formula uses the height and width of the beam appropriately, leading to a revised moment of inertia value. This correction was essential for accurately computing the maximum deflection.

Ultimately, the final decision of approximately 1.52 mm for the maximum deflection at the free end was reached after adjusting the calculations based on the correct moment of inertia. My input helped ensure that the calculations were accurate and reliable.
