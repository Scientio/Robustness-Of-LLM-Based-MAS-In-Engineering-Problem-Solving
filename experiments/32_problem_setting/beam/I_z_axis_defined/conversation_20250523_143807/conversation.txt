##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section that is fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mmÂ²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \(\delta\) is the deflection,
- \(I\) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's first calculate the moment of inertia \(I\):

1. Convert dimensions to consistent units (mm):
   - L = 1000 mm
   - h = 100 mm
   - w = 50 mm

2. Calculate \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \text{ mm}^4
   \]

3. Convert Young's Modulus to consistent units:
   \[
   E = 210 \text{ kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \text{ N/mm}^2
   \]

4. Now, we can substitute into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Let's compute this value step by step.

Can anyone confirm the calculations or suggest any alternative methods?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think we should clarify the moment of inertia formula. For a rectangular cross-section, the correct formula is:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

So let's go through the calculations again using this formula instead of the one you provided.

1. Using the given dimensions:
   - Height \(h = 100\) mm
   - Width \(b = 50\) mm

2. Calculate \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
   \]

3. Now substitute into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
   \]

This should give us the correct maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

where \(b\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. In our case, the width \(w = 50\) mm and the height \(h = 100\) mm. 

Let's go through the calculations correctly:

1. Calculate the moment of inertia \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \text{ mm}^4
   \]

2. Now we substitute into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \(F = 1000 \, \text{N}\)
- \(L = 1000 \, \text{mm}\)
- \(E = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2\)
- \(I = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4\)

Now, substituting these values into the deflection equation:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating \(1000^3 = 10^9\):

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 \approx 263000000000
\]

Now substituting back into the equation gives:

\[
\delta \approx \frac{10^12}{263000000000} \approx 3.80 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.80 mm.

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 3.80 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the reasoning, it appears the values and formulas used are consistent with the problem statement. The moment of inertia was correctly calculated using the formula \(I = \frac{b h^3}{12}\), and the deflection formula for a cantilever beam was applied appropriately.

The final calculated maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.80 mm, which aligns with the expected behavior of a cantilever beam under a point load.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.80 mm.
