##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at its free end. The parameters are as follows: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN 
- Length (L) = 1 m 
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm² 
- Height (h) = 100 mm 
- Width (w) = 50 mm 

To find the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \(I\) first:

1. Convert units where necessary (E should be in consistent units with F, L, h, and w).
2. Substitute the values into the deflection formula.

I would like your thoughts on this approach and any suggestions you might have.
##### ADVISOR:
Team, I see where you're going with this, but we need to clarify the moment of inertia. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section is actually:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

This is crucial because it affects our calculation of deflection. 

Now, let's proceed with the calculations using this formula. 

1. First, we need to ensure all units are consistent. Since \(E = 210 \text{ kN/mm}^2\), we can keep it as is for our calculations.
2. The width \(w\) is given as 50 mm, so we will use that in our calculations.

Now, let's compute \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{100 \text{ mm} \cdot (50 \text{ mm})^3}{12}
\]

After calculating \(I\), we can substitute it back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

This method will give us the correct maximum deflection. If anyone has any further suggestions or insights, feel free to share!
##### LEAD:
While I appreciate your input, I must clarify that the moment of inertia formula you provided is incorrect for this specific case. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \(w\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. 

Let's proceed with the calculations using the correct formula:

1. Calculate \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{50 \text{ mm} \cdot (100 \text{ mm})^3}{12} = \frac{50 \cdot 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

2. Now, we can substitute \(F\), \(L\), \(E\), and \(I\) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Converting \(F = 1 \text{ kN} = 1000 \text{ N}\), \(L = 1000 \text{ mm}\), and \(E = 210 \text{ kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \text{ N/mm}^2\):

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \text{ N} \cdot (1000 \text{ mm})^3}{3 \cdot 210000 \text{ N/mm}^2 \cdot 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \cdot 1000000000000}{3 \cdot 210000 \cdot 4166666.67}
\]

After performing the calculations, we can find the numerical value for the maximum deflection at the free end. 

Let's finalize this computation. 

Preliminary Decision: [The maximum deflection \(\delta\) at the free end is approximately 0.0142 mm.]
##### RETHINKING:
To finalize the calculation for the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam, let's complete the computation step by step:

1. **Calculate the moment of inertia \(I\)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \text{ mm} \cdot (100 \text{ mm})^3}{12} = \frac{50 \cdot 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4
   \]

2. **Substitute values into the deflection formula**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   where:
   - \(F = 1000 \text{ N}\)
   - \(L = 1000 \text{ mm}\)
   - \(E = 210000 \text{ N/mm}^2\)
   - \(I \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4\)

3. **Substituting the values**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \cdot (1000)^3}{3 \cdot 210000 \cdot 4166666.67}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1000 \cdot 1000000000000}{3 \cdot 210000 \cdot 4166666.67}
   \]

   Now, calculating the denominator:
   \[
   3 \cdot 210000 \cdot 4166666.67 \approx 2630000000000
   \]

   Thus, we can compute:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000000000000}{2630000000000} \approx 0.00038 \text{ mm}
   \]

4. **Final Result**:
   After completing the calculations, we find that the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately:
   \[
   \delta \approx 0.00038 \text{ mm} \text{ or } 0.38 \text{ micrometers}
   \]

Final Decision: [The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.00038 mm.]
