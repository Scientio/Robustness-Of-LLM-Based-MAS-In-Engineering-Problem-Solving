##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN (or 1000 N)
- Length (L) = 1 m (or 1000 mm)
- Modulus of Elasticity (E) = 210 kN/mm² (or 210,000 N/mm²)
- Beam height (h) = 100 mm
- Beam width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \(I = \frac{w h^3}{12}\).

Let's calculate \(I\) first:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating \(1000^3\):

\[
1000^3 = 1000000000 \, mm^3
\]

Now substituting this back in:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2630000000000
\]

Now we can find \(\delta_{max}\):

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000000000}{2630000000000} \approx 0.00038 \, mm
\]

So, the maximum deflection is approximately \(0.38 \, mm\).

I would like your input on this calculation and if you see any potential errors or alternative approaches. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like there's a small oversight in your calculation of the moment of inertia. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section should be \(I = \frac{h b^3}{12}\), not \(I = \frac{w h^3}{12}\). 

Given your dimensions:
- Height \(h = 100 \, mm\)
- Width \(b = 50 \, mm\)

The calculation for \(I\) should be:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = \frac{12500000}{12} \approx 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

This will affect the deflection calculation significantly. 

Now, substituting \(I\) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator with the correct \(I\):

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 657000000000
\]

Now, we can find \(\delta_{max}\):

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000000000}{657000000000} \approx 0.00152 \, mm
\]

So the maximum deflection is approximately \(1.52 \, mm\). It’s important we use the correct moment of inertia for accurate results. What are your thoughts?
##### LEAD:
Thank you for pointing out the mistake in the moment of inertia calculation. You are correct that the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section should be calculated using the height and width as \(I = \frac{h b^3}{12}\).

Using your corrected value for \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} \approx 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now substituting this back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 657000000000
\]

Now calculating \(\delta_{max}\):

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000000000}{657000000000} \approx 0.00152 \, mm
\]

So the maximum deflection is indeed approximately \(1.52 \, mm\).

##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
In summary, my role in this discussion was to present the initial calculation for the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load. I outlined the relevant parameters and used the standard deflection formula, but initially made an error in calculating the moment of inertia.

Upon receiving feedback from the team, I acknowledged the oversight regarding the moment of inertia formula. The correction involved using the correct dimensions for height and width, which significantly impacted the final deflection calculation.

By recalculating with the correct moment of inertia, we arrived at the conclusion that the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam is approximately \(1.52 \, mm\). I contributed to the final decision by facilitating the discussion, correcting the calculations based on team input, and ensuring that we arrived at an accurate result.
