##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows:

- Load (F): 1 kN
- Length (L): 1 m
- Modulus of Elasticity (E): 210 kN/mmÂ²
- Height (h): 100 mm
- Width (w): 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the rectangular cross-section, calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \):

1. Convert dimensions to consistent units (mm):
   - \( L = 1000 \, mm \)
   - \( F = 1000 \, N \)
   - \( E = 210 \times 10^3 \, N/mm^2 \)

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

3. Now, substitute \( F \), \( L \), \( E \), and \( I \) into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 416666.67}
   \]

Let's proceed with the calculations. What do you think about this approach? Any suggestions or corrections?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach is mostly correct, but I noticed a small oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. The formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section should actually be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

Instead of \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \). Since we are using height \( h \) and width \( b \), ensure that you consistently apply the correct dimensions to avoid any discrepancies in the calculations. 

Now, let's calculate \( I \) using the correct formula:

1. \( h = 100 \, mm \)
2. \( b = 50 \, mm \)

So,

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substitute this \( I \) value back into the deflection formula. This change will significantly affect the final deflection result. 

Proceed with the calculations, and let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for pointing out the oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. Let's use the correct formula and recalculate \( I \):

1. Given:
   - Height \( h = 100 \, mm \)
   - Width \( b = 50 \, mm \)

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

Now, substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Substituting the known values:
- \( F = 1000 \, N \)
- \( L = 1000 \, mm \)
- \( E = 210 \times 10^3 \, N/mm^2 \)
- \( I = 1041666.67 \, mm^4 \)

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the numerator:
\[
1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 10^9 = 10^12
\]

Calculating the denominator:
\[
3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 1041666.67 \approx 3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 657000000000
\]

Now, substituting these values into the deflection equation:

\[
\delta = \frac{10^12}{657000000000} \approx 1.52 \, mm
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately:

**Preliminary Decision: 1.52 mm** 

Is there anything else you would like to discuss regarding this problem?
