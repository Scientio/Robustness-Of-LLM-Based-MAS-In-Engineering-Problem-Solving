##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a point load at the free end. The parameters we have are:

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mmÂ²
- Beam height (h) = 100 mm
- Beam width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

First, let's calculate the moment of inertia \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Next, we need to convert all our units to be consistent. We will use kN for force, m for length, and mm for dimensions. 

Now we can calculate the maximum deflection using the given values. Let's proceed with the calculations. 

What do you think about this approach? Any suggestions or concerns before we finalize the calculations?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach looks good, but there's a small oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section should actually be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

where \(h\) is the height and \(b\) is the width. 

So, for your parameters:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = \frac{12500000}{12} \approx 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

This will affect the final deflection calculation. Make sure to use this corrected \(I\) value in the deflection formula to get accurate results. 

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I believe there might be a misunderstanding regarding the variables in the moment of inertia formula. The moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \(w\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. In our case, we have:

- Width \(w = 50 \text{ mm}\)
- Height \(h = 100 \text{ mm}\)

So the calculation for \(I\) should be:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, let's use this \(I\) value in the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Substituting in the values:

- \(F = 1 \text{ kN} = 1000 \text{ N}\)
- \(L = 1 \text{ m} = 1000 \text{ mm}\)
- \(E = 210 \text{ kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \text{ N/mm}^2\)
- \(I \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4\)

Calculating:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Now, let's compute this value. 

After calculating, we find:

\[
\delta_{max} \approx 0.025 \text{ mm} \text{ or } 25 \text{ mm}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 25 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the approach taken, I see that the moment of inertia \(I\) was indeed calculated correctly as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Then, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Given:

- \(F = 1000 \text{ N}\)
- \(L = 1000 \text{ mm}\)
- \(E = 210000 \text{ N/mm}^2\)
- \(I \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4\)

The calculation proceeds as follows:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2630000000000
\]

Now, substituting these values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000000000000}{2630000000000} \approx 0.380 \text{ mm}
\]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.380 mm.
