##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows:

- Point load (F) = 1 kN
- Length of the beam (L) = 1 m
- Young's modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height of the beam (h) = 100 mm
- Width of the beam (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section, calculated as \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

First, let's convert all units to be consistent. 

- F = 1 kN = 1000 N
- L = 1 m = 1000 mm
- E = 210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²
- h = 100 mm
- w = 50 mm

Next, we calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, we can substitute the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( (1000)^3 = 1000000000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2630000000000 \)
3. \( \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{2630000000000} \approx 0.379 \, \text{mm} \)

Now, I’d like your input on this calculation. Do you see any errors or have suggestions for alternative methods to verify this result?
##### ADVISOR:
I appreciate your detailed breakdown, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia should actually be calculated using \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \), where \( h \) is the height and \( b \) is the width. 

So, with \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \) and \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} \):

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = \frac{12500000}{12} \approx 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

This will significantly change the calculations for the maximum deflection. 

When substituting this new \( I \) into the deflection formula, it will yield a different result. 

I suggest you double-check this calculation using the provided formula and the correct moment of inertia. This approach should yield a more accurate deflection value.
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is indeed calculated using \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \), where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

In our case, we have:
- Width \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)

Thus, the moment of inertia should be:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, with this value of \( I \), we can substitute it back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating again:

1. \( (1000)^3 = 1000000000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2630000000000 \)
3. \( \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{2630000000000} \approx 0.379 \, \text{mm} \)

This confirms that the maximum deflection at the free end remains approximately \( 0.379 \, \text{mm} \).

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.379 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon re-evaluating the calculations and the moment of inertia, I realize that my explanation and calculations were consistent with the correct formula for the moment of inertia of a rectangular cross-section. The formula \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \) is indeed appropriate for this scenario, where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height.

To summarize:
- The moment of inertia was calculated correctly as:
  \[
  I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
  \]
  
- The maximum deflection at the free end was calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
  \]
  resulting in approximately \( 0.379 \, \text{mm} \).

Given this thorough review, I can confirm that the calculations and the reasoning behind them are accurate. 

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.379 mm.
