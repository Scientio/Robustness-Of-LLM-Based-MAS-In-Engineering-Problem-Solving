        "content": "Your team is given the following problem: A cantilever beam (along x-axis) with a rectangular cross-section (one end fixed horizontally) is subjected to a vertical (positive z-direction) point load F at the free end (F=1kN, length = 1m, E =210kN/mm^2, beam height h=100mm, beam width w=50mm). Find the numerical value of the maximum deflection at the free end. Explain this problem to your team, suggest a solution and ask for their advice."

        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows:\n\n- Point load (F) = 1 kN\n- Length of the beam (L) = 1 m\n- Young's modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm\u00b2\n- Height of the beam (h) = 100 mm\n- Width of the beam (w) = 50 mm\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section, calculated as \\( I = \\frac{w h^3}{12} \\).\n\nFirst, let's convert all units to be consistent. \n\n- F = 1 kN = 1000 N\n- L = 1 m = 1000 mm\n- E = 210 kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000 N/mm\u00b2\n- h = 100 mm\n- w = 50 mm\n\nNext, we calculate the moment of inertia \\( I \\):\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 1000000}{12} = \\frac{50000000}{12} \\approx 4166666.67 \\, \\text{mm}^4\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210000 \\times 4166666.67}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\( (1000)^3 = 1000000000 \\)\n2. \\( 3 \\times 210000 \\times 4166666.67 \\approx 2630000000000 \\)\n3. \\( \\delta_{max} = \\frac{1000 \\times 1000000000}{2630000000000} \\approx 0.379 \\, \\text{mm} \\)\n\nNow, I\u2019d like your input on this calculation.
