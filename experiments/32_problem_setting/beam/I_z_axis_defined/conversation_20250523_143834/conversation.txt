##### LEAD:
The problem involves calculating the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end. Given the parameters: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN = 1000 N
- Length (L) = 1 m = 1000 mm
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection, we can use the formula for deflection at the free end of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = \frac{50,000,000}{12} \approx 4,166,667 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now substituting \( I \) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating \( \delta_{max} \):

1. Calculate \( L^3 \):
   \[
   (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \, \text{mm}^3
   \]

2. Now substitute and solve:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
   \]

3. Simplifying:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
   \]

4. Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,617,500,000
   \]

5. Finally:
   \[
   \delta_{max} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,617,500,000} \approx 381.0 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Now I will ask the team for their input on this calculation and if they believe we need to consider any additional factors. 

What do you think about this approach? Any suggestions?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach is fundamentally flawed because you used the incorrect formula for the moment of inertia. The correct formula for a rectangular cross-section should be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

This change will significantly impact the calculations. Since the height \( h \) is 100 mm and width \( b \) is 50 mm, substituting these values will yield a different moment of inertia. 

Instead of using the incorrect \( I \) you calculated, please ensure to use:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12}
\]

This will lead to a different maximum deflection value, which is crucial for our analysis. I suggest recalculating the deflection using the correct moment of inertia. 

Let’s see how this affects the results!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your feedback. Let's recalculate the moment of inertia using the correct formula for a rectangular cross-section:

Given:
- Height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
- Width \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

The correct moment of inertia \( I \) is:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12}
\]

Calculating \( b^3 \):

\[
(50)^3 = 125,000 \, \text{mm}^3
\]

Now substituting back into the moment of inertia formula:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times 125,000}{12} = \frac{12,500,000}{12} \approx 1,041,667 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting \( I \) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Substituting the known values:

1. Load \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
2. Length \( L = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
3. Young's Modulus \( E = 210,000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
4. Moment of Inertia \( I \approx 1,041,667 \, \text{mm}^4 \)

Now we calculate:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,667}
\]

Calculating \( L^3 \):

\[
(1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \, \text{mm}^3
\]

Now substituting:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,667}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,667 \approx 655,500,000
\]

Finally, calculating \( \delta_{max} \):

\[
\delta_{max} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{655,500,000} \approx 1524.0 \, \text{mm}
\]

This indicates a significant deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam. 

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1524.0 mm. 

Does this revised calculation align with your expectations?
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and ensuring all the parameters are correctly accounted for, the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end has been recalculated using the correct formula for the moment of inertia. 

The steps taken include:

1. Correctly calculating the moment of inertia \( I \) using:
   \[
   I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125,000}{12} \approx 1,041,667 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

2. Substituting into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   With the values:
   - \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
   - \( L = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
   - \( E = 210,000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
   - \( I \approx 1,041,667 \, \text{mm}^4 \)

3. Completing the calculation:
   \[
   \delta_{max} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{655,500,000} \approx 1524.0 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **1524.0 mm**.
