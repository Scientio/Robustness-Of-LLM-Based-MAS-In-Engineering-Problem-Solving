##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a point load is applied at the free end. The beam has a rectangular cross-section and is fixed at one end. We need to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end due to the applied load.

To solve this, we can use the formula for the maximum deflection \( \delta \) of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the point load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section.

For a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Where:
- \( w \) is the width of the beam (50 mm),
- \( h \) is the height of the beam (100 mm).

Let's calculate \( I \) first:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Let's simplify this calculation step-by-step. Can anyone assist with the numerical evaluation?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think we should clarify the moment of inertia formula first. For a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

This is crucial for our calculations. So, let’s calculate \( I \) with this formula:

Given:
- \( h = 100 \) mm,
- \( b = 50 \) mm,

We can calculate:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = \frac{12500000}{12} \approx 1,041,666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now we can substitute this value into the deflection formula. Let's proceed with the calculation for \( \delta \):

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,666.67}
\]

If you need help with the numerical evaluation, just let me know!
##### LEAD:
It appears there is a misunderstanding in the application of the moment of inertia formula. For a rectangular cross-section, the correct formula is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. Since we have \( w = 50 \) mm and \( h = 100 \) mm, let's calculate \( I \) correctly:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67 \approx 2,628,000,000,000 \)

Now substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.380 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.380 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.380 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.380 mm.
