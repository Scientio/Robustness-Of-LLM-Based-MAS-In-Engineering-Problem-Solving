        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a point load is applied at the free end. The beam has a rectangular cross-section and is fixed at one end. We need to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end due to the applied load.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the formula for the maximum deflection \\( \\delta \\) of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the point load (1 kN = 1000 N),\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),\n- \\( E \\) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000 N/mm\u00b2),\n- \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section.\n\nFor a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia \\( I \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{w h^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( w \\) is the width of the beam (50 mm),\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the beam (100 mm).\n\nLet's calculate \\( I \\) first:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \\text{ mm}^4\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting the values into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210,000 \\times 4,166,666.67}\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify this calculation step-by-step. Can anyone assist with the numerical evaluation?"

For a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia \\( I \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{h b^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nThis is crucial for our calculations. So, let\u2019s calculate \\( I \\) with this formula:\n\nGiven:\n- \\( h = 100 \\) mm,\n- \\( b = 50 \\) mm,\n\nWe can calculate:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{100 \\times (50)^3}{12} = \\frac{100 \\times 125000}{12} = \\frac{12500000}{12} \\approx 1,041,666.67 \\text{ mm}^4\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute this value into the deflection formula. Let's proceed with the calculation for \\( \\delta \\):\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210,000 \\times 1,041,666.67}\n\\]\n\nIf you need help with the numerical evaluation, just let me know!"
