##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Modulus of Elasticity (E) = 210 kN/mmÂ²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( \delta \) is the deflection
- \( F \) is the load
- \( L \) is the length of the beam
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section

The moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Now, let's calculate \( I \):

1. Convert units where necessary: 
   - \( w = 50 mm = 0.05 m \)
   - \( h = 100 mm = 0.1 m \)
   - \( E = 210 kN/mm^2 = 210 \times 10^3 N/mm^2 = 210 \times 10^9 N/m^2 \)

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{0.05 \times (0.1)^3}{12} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.001}{12} = \frac{0.00005}{12} = 4.1667 \times 10^{-6} m^4
   \]

3. Now substitute into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 N \times (1)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^9) \times (4.1667 \times 10^{-6})}
   \]

4. Calculate \( \delta \):
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000}{3 \times 210 \times 10^9 \times 4.1667 \times 10^{-6}}
   \]

Let's compute this value.

Before we proceed, does anyone have advice on this calculation or any potential pitfalls we should consider?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think there might be a misunderstanding in the calculation of the moment of inertia. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

Where:
- \( h \) is the height (100 mm or 0.1 m)
- \( b \) is the width (50 mm or 0.05 m)

So, using this formula:

1. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{0.1 \times (0.05)^3}{12} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.000125}{12} = \frac{0.0000125}{12} = 1.04167 \times 10^{-6} m^4
   \]

2. Now substitute this value into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 N \times (1)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^9) \times (1.04167 \times 10^{-6})}
   \]

3. Calculate \( \delta \):
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000}{3 \times 210 \times 10^9 \times 1.04167 \times 10^{-6}}
   \]

This should lead us to the correct deflection value. But remember, it's crucial to use \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \) for this calculation. Any other approach might lead to incorrect results. Let's proceed with these calculations!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. In our case, the width \( w \) is 50 mm and the height \( h \) is 100 mm.

Let's confirm the calculation of \( I \) using the correct formula:

1. Convert the dimensions to meters:
   - \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \)
   - \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \)

2. Calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{0.05 \times (0.1)^3}{12} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.001}{12} = \frac{0.00005}{12} = 4.1667 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^4
   \]

Now we can proceed with the deflection calculation using the correct \( I \):

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \, \text{N} \times (1 \, \text{m})^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^9 \, \text{N/m}^2) \times (4.1667 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^4)}
\]

Now, let's calculate \( \delta \):

1. Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   3 \times 210 \times 10^9 \times 4.1667 \times 10^{-6} \approx 2.6283 \times 10^6
   \]

2. Now calculate \( \delta \):
   \[
   \delta \approx \frac{1000}{2.6283 \times 10^6} \approx 3.805 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m} = 0.3805 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.3805 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the reasoning, I can confirm that the correct approach and formulas were used. The moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section was calculated appropriately using:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

The dimensions were correctly converted to meters, and the subsequent calculations for deflection using the formula for a cantilever beam under a point load were executed accurately. 

The final computed maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam was approximately:

\[
\delta \approx 0.3805 \, \text{mm}
\]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.3805 mm.
