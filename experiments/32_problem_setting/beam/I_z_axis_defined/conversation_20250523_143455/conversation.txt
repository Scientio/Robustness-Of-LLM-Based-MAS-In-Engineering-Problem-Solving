##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters we have are:

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \):

1. Convert dimensions to consistent units (mm):
   - L = 1000 mm
   - h = 100 mm
   - w = 50 mm

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. Substitute values into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Now, I would like your advice on the calculations and if there are any potential errors or considerations we should take into account.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there is a key error in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

So, you should use the height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \) and width \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} \) in your calculations. 

Let's recalculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substitute this corrected value of \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

This will give you a more accurate deflection value. Make sure to double-check the calculations with this updated moment of inertia.
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the correction regarding the moment of inertia. However, I must clarify that the formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. In our case, we should use:

- Width \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)

So the correct calculation for \( I \) is:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
2. \( L = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
3. \( E = 210000 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210000000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)

Now, substituting these values in:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000 \, \text{N mm}^3
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000000 \times 416666.67 \approx 263750000000000
\]

Finally, calculating the deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000000}{263750000000000} \approx 0.00379 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 3.79 mm.

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 3.79 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the formulae used, I can confirm that the moment of inertia was correctly calculated using the dimensions provided. However, I made an error in the final calculation of the deflection.

Let’s summarize the calculations again to ensure clarity:

1. **Given Parameters:**
   - Load, \( F = 1 \, \text{kN} = 1000 \, \text{N} \)

   - Young's Modulus, \( E = 210 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
   - Height, \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
   - Width, \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

2. **Moment of Inertia Calculation:**
   \[
   I = \frac{b h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. **Deflection Formula:**
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]

4. **Substituting Values:**
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

5. **Numerator Calculation:**
   \[
   1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000 \, \text{N mm}^3
   \]

6. **Denominator Calculation:**
   \[
   3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 = 263750000000 \, \text{N mm}^2
   \]

7. **Final Deflection Calculation:**
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000000000000}{263750000000} \approx 3.79 \, \text{mm}
   \]

After confirming these calculations, I can state that the maximum deflection at the free end is indeed approximately **3.79 mm**.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately **3.79 mm**.
