##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section that is fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters we have are:

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let’s compute \(I\) first, then use it to find the maximum deflection. The units need to be consistent, so we should convert everything to mm and kN:

- F = 1000 N
- L = 1000 mm
- E = 210000 kN/m² = 210000 N/mm²

Now, let’s calculate \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now substituting into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating \( \delta_{max} \):

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Let’s compute this value step-by-step to ensure accuracy. 

I would like your insights on this approach and any recommendations for the calculations.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think we should stick with the moment of inertia formula I = \(\frac{h b^3}{12}\) for our rectangular cross-section instead of what you mentioned. 

So, let's calculate \(I\) using the correct parameters:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = \frac{12500000}{12} \approx 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now substituting this into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

This will give us a different result. 

Let’s proceed with these calculations and see what we get. Your thoughts?
##### LEAD:
I appreciate your input, but the moment of inertia formula for a rectangular cross-section is indeed given by \(I = \frac{w h^3}{12}\), where \(w\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. 

In our case:
- Width \(w = 50 \, mm\)
- Height \(h = 100 \, mm\)

Thus, the correct calculation for \(I\) should remain:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, mm^4
\]

This value is crucial to maintaining accuracy in our deflection calculation. 

Now, substituting this back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \(1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 10^{9} = 10^{12}\).
2. Calculate \(3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67\).

Let's compute \(3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67\):

\[
3 \times 210000 \approx 630000
\]
\[
630000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2625000000000
\]

Now, substituting these values back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{10^{12}}{2625000000000} \approx 0.38 \, mm
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately \(0.38 \, mm\).

Preliminary Decision: \(0.38 \, mm\)
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations, the approach used to derive the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam appears sound, but we should double-check the numerical values to ensure accuracy.

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   - The correct formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:
     \[
     I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, mm^4
     \]

2. **Deflection Formula**:
   - The maximum deflection formula for a cantilever beam under a point load at the end is:
     \[
     \delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     - \(F = 1000 \, N\)
     - \(L = 1000 \, mm\)
     - \(E = 210000 \, N/mm^2\)
     - \(I \approx 4166666.67 \, mm^4\)

3. **Deflection Calculation**:
   - First, calculate \(L^3\):
     \[
     L^3 = (1000)^3 = 10^9 \, mm^3
     \]
   - Now substituting into the deflection formula:
     \[
     \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
     \]
   - Calculate the denominator:
     \[
     3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2625000000000
     \]
   - Now substituting back into the deflection formula:
     \[
     \delta_{max} = \frac{10^{12}}{2625000000000} \approx 0.38 \, mm
     \]

Thus, after re-evaluating the calculations, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam remains approximately **0.38 mm**.

Final Decision: **0.38 mm**
