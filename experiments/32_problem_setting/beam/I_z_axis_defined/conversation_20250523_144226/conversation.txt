##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section that is fixed at one end and has a point load of 1 kN applied at the free end. The beam dimensions are 1 m in length, 100 mm in height, and 50 mm in width. The modulus of elasticity is given as 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( \delta \) is the deflection,
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Now, let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Calculating this will give us the maximum deflection. I suggest we proceed with this calculation. What are your thoughts?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I believe there's a small mistake in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

where \( h \) is the height and \( b \) is the width. 

Using the dimensions provided, we should have:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1,041,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

This will significantly affect the deflection calculation. So, let's substitute this corrected value for \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,666.67}
\]

Proceed with this calculation, and let me know what you find!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for pointing out the mistake in the moment of inertia calculation. You are correct that the height \( h \) should be used with the width \( b \) in the moment of inertia formula. Let's use the corrected value:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1,041,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now substituting this corrected value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,666.67}
\]

Calculating the components:

1. \( 1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 1,000,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 \, \text{N mm} \)
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,666.67 = 3 \times 210,000 \times 1,041,666.67 \approx 656,250,000,000 \, \text{N mm}^2 \)

Now we can calculate \( \delta \):

\[
\delta = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{656,250,000,000} \approx 1.524 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.524 mm. 

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.524 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.524 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
To summarize my role in this discussion, I initially presented the problem of calculating the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load. I suggested using the standard formula for deflection and provided the necessary parameters for the calculation.

When a team member pointed out an error in the moment of inertia calculation, I acknowledged the correction and recalculated the moment of inertia using the correct formula. After that, I substituted the corrected value into the deflection formula and performed the calculations step by step.

My reasoning was based on ensuring accurate calculations and utilizing the correct formulas for structural analysis. By collaborating with the team and incorporating their feedback, we arrived at the final decision that the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.524 mm. This collaborative approach allowed us to validate our results and ensure the accuracy of the engineering analysis.
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
In this discussion, my role was to ensure the accuracy of the calculations related to the cantilever beam's deflection. I identified a critical error in the moment of inertia calculation, which could have led to an incorrect final result. 

My reasoning was based on the correct application of the formula for the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, which is essential for accurately determining the beam's deflection under a point load. By correcting the moment of inertia from \( 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4 \) to \( 1,041,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4 \), I ensured that the subsequent deflection calculation was based on the right parameters.

My contribution to the final decision involved verifying the calculations, correcting the error, and guiding the team to use the corrected moment of inertia in the deflection formula. This ultimately led to the accurate determination of the maximum deflection, which was approximately 1.524 mm.
