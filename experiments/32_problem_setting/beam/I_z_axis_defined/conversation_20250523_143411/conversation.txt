##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end, which is given by:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \(I\) first:

- Convert dimensions to consistent units (mm):
  - L = 1000 mm
  - F = 1000 N
  - E = 210,000 N/mm²
  - h = 100 mm
  - w = 50 mm

Now, calculate \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substitute \(F\), \(L\), \(E\), and \(I\) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating this will give us the maximum deflection. 

I would like your input on whether we should proceed with this calculation or if there are any other considerations or methods we should explore.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I believe there's a small error in the calculation of the moment of inertia \(I\). The correct formula for the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section should be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

where \(h\) is the height and \(b\) is the width. 

So, using the parameters:
- \(h = 100 \, mm\)
- \(b = 50 \, mm\)

The calculation for \(I\) would be:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

With this corrected \(I\), you can proceed with the deflection calculation using the same deflection formula. This adjustment is crucial for accurate results, so it's good we caught it. Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for pointing out the correction regarding the moment of inertia \(I\). You are right; the correct formula uses the height \(h\) and width \(b\) as follows:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

Using the parameters:
- \(h = 100 \, mm\)
- \(b = 50 \, mm\)

The calculation for \(I\) is:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected \(I\) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]
\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000000}{657000000000}
\]
\[
\delta \approx 1.52 \, mm
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations with the corrected moment of inertia \(I\), we have:

1. The correct formula for the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is:
   \[
   I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
   \]
   where \(h = 100 \, mm\) and \(b = 50 \, mm\).

2. The calculation for \(I\) is:
   \[
   I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

3. Using the deflection formula for a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   with \(F = 1000 \, N\), \(L = 1000 \, mm\), \(E = 210000 \, N/mm^2\), and \(I = 1041666.67 \, mm^4\), we substitute the values:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
   \]

4. Performing the calculations step by step:
   - \(L^3 = (1000)^3 = 10^9 \, mm^3\)
   - The denominator:
     \[
     3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 657000000000
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \delta \approx \frac{1000000000000}{657000000000} \approx 1.52 \, mm
     \]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **1.52 mm**.
