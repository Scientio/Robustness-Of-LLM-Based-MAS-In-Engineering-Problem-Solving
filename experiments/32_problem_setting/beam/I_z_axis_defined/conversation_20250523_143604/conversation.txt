##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where we need to determine the maximum deflection at the free end due to a point load. The beam has a rectangular cross-section, fixed at one end, and the load is applied at the free end.

To solve this, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( \delta \) = maximum deflection
- \( F \) = applied load (1 kN = 1000 N)
- \( L \) = length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm)
- \( E \) = modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²)
- \( I \) = moment of inertia of the rectangular section, calculated as \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \)

First, let's calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 41666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 41666.67}
\]

Calculating the values:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 41666.67}
\]

Let’s compute this step by step to find the numerical value of the maximum deflection. 

What do you think about this approach? Any suggestions or concerns?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach looks solid, but there's a small mistake in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is actually \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \), where \( h \) is the height and \( b \) is the width of the beam. 

Since you have specified \( w \) instead of \( b \), ensure that you are using the correct dimensions. 

Everything else seems fine, but remember to double-check the values and units throughout your calculations. This will ensure accuracy in your final deflection result. 

Let me know if you need any further clarification or assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input. However, the moment of inertia formula I used is indeed correct for a rectangular cross-section, where \( I = \frac{b h^3}{12} \). In this case, \( b \) is the width (50 mm) and \( h \) is the height (100 mm). 

Let’s clarify:
- \( b = 50 \, mm \)
- \( h = 100 \, mm \)

Thus, the moment of inertia \( I \) is calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 41666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting the values back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 41666.67}
\]

Calculating the deflection step-by-step:

1. \( 1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 10^9 = 10^{12} \, N \cdot mm^3 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210000 \times 41666.67 = 3 \times 210000 \times 41666.67 \approx 26300000000 \, N \cdot mm^2 \)

Now, calculating \( \delta \):

\[
\delta = \frac{10^{12}}{26300000000} \approx 38.0 \, mm
\]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 38.0 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 38.0 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon re-evaluating the calculations, I confirm that the approach used is correct, and the moment of inertia was calculated properly for the rectangular cross-section. The deflection formula was applied correctly, and the calculations were followed step-by-step.

The final calculated value for the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 38.0 mm.

Final Decision: 38.0 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
To summarize my role in this discussion, I initially presented the problem of calculating the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load. I proposed a solution using the standard formula for deflection and correctly calculated the moment of inertia for the beam's rectangular cross-section.

When feedback was provided about a potential miscalculation regarding the moment of inertia, I clarified that the formula used was indeed appropriate for the dimensions given (width and height) and confirmed the calculations step-by-step. 

My reasoning was based on standard engineering principles and formulas, ensuring accuracy throughout the calculations. I contributed to the final decision by verifying the calculations and confirming that the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 38.0 mm.

This collaborative effort helped ensure clarity and accuracy in our approach to the problem. If there are any further questions or if additional assistance is needed, please let me know!
