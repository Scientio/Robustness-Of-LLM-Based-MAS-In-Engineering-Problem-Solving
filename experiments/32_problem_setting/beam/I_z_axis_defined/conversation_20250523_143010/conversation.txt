##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where we need to determine the maximum deflection at the free end due to a point load. The beam is fixed at one end and has a rectangular cross-section. Given the load F of 1 kN, a length of 1 m, Young's modulus E of 210 kN/mm², height h of 100 mm, and width w of 50 mm, we need to apply the appropriate formula to calculate the deflection.

The formula for the maximum deflection \( \delta_{max} \) at the free end of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end is given by:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, calculated as \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

Let's calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating this gives us:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Now, I’d like to hear your thoughts on this approach and any possible checks we should perform to ensure accuracy.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there's a small adjustment needed regarding the moment of inertia. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

In your case, that means:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this updated value of \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

This will yield a different deflection result. Make sure to double-check the calculations with this new moment of inertia. It's crucial for accuracy!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the correction regarding the moment of inertia. Let's recalculate using the correct formula for \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{h w^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now substituting this updated value of \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating it step by step:

1. \( 1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 10^9 = 10^{12} \, N \cdot mm \)
2. \( 3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 657000000000 \, N \cdot mm^2 \)

Now we can calculate \( \delta_{max} \):

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{10^{12}}{657000000000} \approx 1.52 \, mm
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
In this discussion, my role was to lead the analysis of the cantilever beam problem by initially proposing a method to calculate the maximum deflection due to a point load. I began by outlining the relevant formula and the parameters involved, helping the team understand the problem's context.

Upon receiving feedback regarding the moment of inertia, I acknowledged the correction and recalculated the moment of inertia using the correct formula for a rectangular cross-section. This adjustment was crucial for ensuring the accuracy of the final deflection calculation.

By substituting the corrected moment of inertia into the deflection formula, I was able to derive the correct maximum deflection value of approximately 1.52 mm. My contribution involved not only the initial calculations but also the willingness to adapt and refine our approach based on team input, leading to a more accurate solution. This collaborative effort ultimately ensured that we arrived at a reliable final decision regarding the beam's deflection.
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
In this discussion, my role was to ensure the accuracy of the calculations related to the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam under a point load. I reasoned that the initial moment of inertia calculation was incorrect because it used the wrong dimensions for the rectangular cross-section. I provided the correct formula for the moment of inertia and recalculated it, which was essential for determining the deflection accurately.

I contributed to the final decision by clarifying the correct approach to calculating the moment of inertia and ensuring that the deflection formula was applied correctly. This led to the accurate conclusion that the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.52 mm. My input helped to validate the calculations and ensure that the team could rely on the final result.
