##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The beam length is 1 m, and the material has a Young's modulus of 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( \delta \) = maximum deflection
- \( F \) = point load (1 kN = 1000 N)
- \( L \) = length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm)
- \( E \) = Young's modulus (210 kN/mm² = 210000 N/mm²)
- \( I \) = moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \)

Let's calculate \( I \):
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now substituting the values into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating \( \delta \):
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Let's compute this step-by-step to get the numerical value. 

What do you think about this approach? Do you have any suggestions or concerns before we proceed with the calculations?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach is mostly correct, but I noticed a small error in the moment of inertia formula you used. The moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section should actually be calculated using \( I = \frac{h b^3}{12} \) instead of \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \). 

This is crucial because it changes the dimensions in the calculation. Let's recalculate \( I \) with the correct formula:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = \frac{12500000}{12} \approx 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

This will yield a different value for the maximum deflection. Please proceed with these values, and I’m confident we’ll get a reliable result. Let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input. However, I believe there is a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia calculation. For a rectangular cross-section, the correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) is indeed \( I = \frac{b h^3}{12} \) where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height.

In our case:
- Width \( w = 50 \) mm
- Height \( h = 100 \) mm

Thus, the correct calculation for \( I \) is:
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
1. Calculate \( (1000)^3 = 1000000000000 \) mm³.
2. Now multiply by \( 1000 \): \( 1000 \times 1000000000000 = 1000000000000 \) N·mm³.
3. Calculate the denominator: \( 3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2632500000000 \) N·mm⁴.

Now, calculate \( \delta \):
\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000000}{2632500000000} \approx 0.379 \text{ mm}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.379 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and confirming the approach, I can summarize the findings clearly:

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**: The moment of inertia \( I \) for the rectangular cross-section was correctly calculated using the formula \( I = \frac{b h^3}{12} \), with \( b = 50 \) mm and \( h = 100 \) mm, yielding approximately \( 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4 \).

2. **Deflection Calculation**: The deflection \( \delta \) at the free end of the cantilever beam was calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   - \( F = 1000 \) N
   - \( L = 1000 \) mm
   - \( E = 210000 \) N/mm²
   - \( I \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4 \)

   This resulted in a maximum deflection of approximately \( 0.379 \) mm.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **0.379 mm**.
