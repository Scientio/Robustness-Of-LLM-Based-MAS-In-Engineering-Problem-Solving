##### LEAD:
Team, we need to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with the following parameters:

- Length (L) = 1 m
- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm² (which we need to convert to N/m² for calculations)
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

The formula for the maximum deflection (δ) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end is given by:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's first convert the units properly. 

1. Convert E from kN/mm² to N/m²:
   \[
   E = 210 \times 10^3 \text{ N/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^3 \times 10^6 \text{ N/m}^2 = 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2
   \]

2. Calculate the moment of inertia \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} \text{ mm}^4 = \frac{50 \times 10^3 \text{ mm}^4}{12} = \frac{50 \times 10^{-3} \times 10^{12}}{12} \text{ m}^4 = \frac{50 \times 10^9}{12} \text{ m}^4
   \]

3. Now, substitute \(F\), \(L\), \(E\), and \(I\) into the deflection formula to find \(\delta\).

I would like your input on these calculations and if there are any other methods or considerations we should take into account for accuracy. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
Team, it looks like you've got the right approach, but let's clarify the moment of inertia formula. For a rectangular beam, the moment of inertia \(I\) should actually be calculated using:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

This is a crucial detail, as it directly influences our deflection calculations. 

Now, let's ensure we have the right values plugged in:

1. **Convert Young's Modulus (E)** to N/m², which you did correctly.
2. **Calculate the moment of inertia \(I\)** using the correct formula:
   \[
   I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} \text{ mm}^4 = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} \text{ mm}^4 = \frac{12500000}{12} \text{ mm}^4
   \]
   Convert to m⁴:
   \[
   I = \frac{12500000 \times 10^{-12}}{12} \text{ m}^4
   \]

3. Substitute \(F\), \(L\), \(E\), and the corrected \(I\) into the deflection formula to find \(\delta\).

This adjustment is essential for an accurate result. Let’s proceed with these calculations, and if anyone has other methods or considerations, feel free to share!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the clarification on the moment of inertia formula. Let's proceed with the calculations using the corrected values:

1. **Convert Young's Modulus (E)**: 
   \[
   E = 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the moment of inertia \(I\)** using the correct formula:
   \[
   I = \frac{h b^3}{12} = \frac{100 \text{ mm} \times (50 \text{ mm})^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} \text{ mm}^4 = \frac{12500000}{12} \text{ mm}^4 \approx 1041666.67 \text{ mm}^4
   \]
   Convert to m⁴:
   \[
   I = 1041666.67 \times 10^{-12} \text{ m}^4 = 1.04167 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4
   \]

3. **Substitute \(F\), \(L\), \(E\), and \(I\) into the deflection formula**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I} = \frac{1000 \text{ N} \times (1 \text{ m})^3}{3 \times 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 \times 1.04167 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4}
   \]

Calculating this gives:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1}{3 \times 210 \times 10^9 \times 1.04167 \times 10^{-6}} \approx \frac{1000}{3 \times 210 \times 10^3} \approx \frac{1000}{630000000} \approx 1.587 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} \approx 1.587 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **1.587 mm**.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 1.587 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and reasoning, the steps taken to determine the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam were accurate, with the correct application of the moment of inertia formula and proper unit conversions. The final result of approximately **1.587 mm** for the maximum deflection at the free end is consistent with the physics of the problem.

Final Decision: **1.587 mm**.
