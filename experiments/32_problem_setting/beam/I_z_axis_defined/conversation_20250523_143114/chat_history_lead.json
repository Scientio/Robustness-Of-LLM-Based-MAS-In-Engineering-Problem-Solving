        "content": "Your team is given the following problem: A cantilever beam (along x-axis) with a rectangular cross-section (one end fixed horizontally) is subjected to a vertical (positive z-direction) point load F at the free end (F=1kN, length = 1m, E =210kN/mm^2, beam height h=100mm, beam width w=50mm). Find the numerical value of the maximum deflection at the free end. Explain this problem to your team, suggest a solution and ask for their advice."

        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at its free end. The parameters are as follows: \n\n- Load (F) = 1 kN\n- Length (L) = 1 m\n- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm\u00b2\n- Height (h) = 100 mm\n- Width (w) = 50 mm\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section, given by:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{w h^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( I \\) first:\n\n1.

The formula for the moment of inertia \\( I \\) for a rectangular cross-section should actually be:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{h b^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nThis means we should be using the height \\( h \\) as 100 mm and the width \\( b \\) as 50 mm in our calculations. \n\nLet's proceed with this formula to ensure we have the correct moment of inertia:\n\n1.
