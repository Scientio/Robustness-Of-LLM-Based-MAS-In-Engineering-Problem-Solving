##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section that is fixed at one end and has a point load of 1 kN applied at the free end. The beam's length is 1 m, the height is 100 mm, and the width is 50 mm. We need to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end.

To solve this, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( \delta \) is the deflection,
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

First, we calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Let's compute this step by step. 

Can you verify the calculations and provide any insights or alternative methods to ensure we're on the right track?
##### ADVISOR:
Sure, let's verify the calculations you've provided. 

You've correctly identified the formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

However, I must point out that the correct formula for the moment of inertia for your beam, which is a rectangular cross-section, should actually be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

Now, using the values provided:
- Height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
- Width \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

The calculation for \( I \) would be:

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12} = \frac{100 \times 125000}{12} = 1041666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value of \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 1041666.67 \approx 657000000000
\]

Now, calculating the deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{657000000000} \approx 1.52 \, \text{mm}
\]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately \( 1.52 \, \text{mm} \). 

This confirms that your calculations are on the right track, but remember to use the correct moment of inertia formula to ensure accuracy.
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input. However, I believe there might be a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia calculation. The formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. In our case, we have:

- Width \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)

So, the correct calculation for \( I \) is:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 4,166,666.67 \approx 2,628,000,000,000
\]

Now, calculating the deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.38 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately \( 0.38 \, \text{mm} \).

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately \( 0.38 \, \text{mm} \).
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the reasoning presented, it appears that I made an error in the calculations of the deflection. Let's summarize and verify the correct values one more time to ensure clarity.

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   For a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:
   \[
   I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
   \]
   where:
   - Width \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
   - Height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)

   Therefore:
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

2. **Deflection Calculation**:
   The formula for the deflection \( \delta \) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end is:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   where:
   - \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
   - \( L = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
   - \( E = 210,000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
   - \( I = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4 \)

   Substituting these values in:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4,166,666.67}
   \]

   Calculating the denominator:
   \[
   3 \times 210000 \times 4,166,666.67 \approx 2,628,000,000,000
   \]

   Now, calculating the deflection:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.38 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately \( 0.38 \, \text{mm} \).

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately \( 0.38 \, \text{mm} \).
