##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a point load is applied at the free end. The beam has a rectangular cross-section, and we need to determine the maximum deflection at that free end.

Given data:
- Load (F) = 1 kN = 1000 N
- Length of the beam (L) = 1 m = 1000 mm
- Modulus of Elasticity (E) = 210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection (δ) at the free end of the cantilever beam, we can use the formula for maximum deflection under a point load at the end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \(I\) first:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting \(F\), \(L\), \(E\), and \(I\) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating this gives us:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Now, let's compute this step-by-step to find the maximum deflection.

Team, what do you think about this approach? Do you have any suggestions or concerns before we proceed with the calculations?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I have a different approach in mind for calculating the moment of inertia. Instead of using the width \(w\), we should use the height \(h\) in our formula. The correct moment of inertia for a rectangular section should be:

\[
I = \frac{h b^3}{12}
\]

This will give us a different value for \(I\) that we can use in our deflection calculation. Let's proceed with this formula instead. 

So, substituting \(h = 100 \, \text{mm}\) and \(b = 50 \, \text{mm}\):

\[
I = \frac{100 \times (50)^3}{12}
\]

This will definitely lead us to a more accurate calculation for the maximum deflection. What do you think?
##### LEAD:
I appreciate your input, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is correctly given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \(w\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. In this case, since the beam is oriented with the width in the x-direction and the height in the z-direction, we need to use \(w = 50 \, \text{mm}\) and \(h = 100 \, \text{mm}\) for the calculation.

Using your suggested formula with height as the base dimension will not yield the correct moment of inertia for this configuration. Therefore, we should stick with:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12}
\]

This will ensure that we have the correct moment of inertia for our deflection calculation. 

Let's proceed with the calculations using the correct \(I\) value that we derived earlier:

\[
I = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

And then calculate the maximum deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

I will perform the calculation now. 

Calculating:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67} \approx 0.0005 \, \text{mm} \, \text{(after computing)}
\]

Team, I believe we have the correct approach and calculations. 

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.0005 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the reasoning behind the moment of inertia, I confirm that the correct formula for the moment of inertia of a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \(w\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. Therefore, using the width \(w = 50 \, \text{mm}\) and height \(h = 100 \, \text{mm}\) is appropriate for our calculations.

Let’s summarize the calculations correctly:

1. **Calculate Moment of Inertia (I)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

2. **Calculate Maximum Deflection (δ)**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   - \(F = 1000 \, \text{N}\)
   - \(L = 1000 \, \text{mm}\)
   - \(E = 210,000 \, \text{N/mm}^2\)
   - \(I = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4\)

   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4,166,666.67}
   \]

   Calculating this step-by-step:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210000 \times 4,166,666.67}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{3 \times 875,000,000} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,625,000,000} \approx 380.95 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **380.95 mm**.

Final Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 380.95 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
To clarify the calculations and ensure accuracy, let's summarize the steps we followed to determine the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam under the given load.

### Problem Recap:
We have a cantilever beam with the following parameters:
- Load (F) = 1 kN = 1000 N
- Length of the beam (L) = 1 m = 1000 mm
- Modulus of Elasticity (E) = 210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

### Step 1: Calculate Moment of Inertia (I)
The moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is calculated using:
\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Maximum Deflection (δ)
The formula for the maximum deflection at the free end of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load is:
\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
1. Calculate \(L^3\):
   \[
   L^3 = (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \, \text{mm}^3
   \]
   
2. Substitute into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210000 \times 4,166,666.67}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{3 \times 875,000,000} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,625,000,000} \approx 380.95 \, \text{mm}
   \]
