##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows: load F = 1 kN, length L = 1 m, modulus of elasticity E = 210 kN/mm², beam height h = 100 mm, and beam width w = 50 mm. 

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate the moment of inertia first and then use it to find the maximum deflection. 

Can anyone confirm the calculations and suggest if there are any additional factors we should consider?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I believe there’s a small mistake in the moment of inertia formula you provided. For a rectangular cross-section, the correct moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{36}
\]

So, using this formula, let's calculate the moment of inertia with the given dimensions:

- Beam height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
- Beam width \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

Now, substituting into the formula:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{36} \approx 1388888.89 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, we can plug this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Substituting the values:

- \( F = 1 \, \text{kN} = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
- \( L = 1 \, \text{m} = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( E = 210 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)

Calculating the deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 1388888.89}
\]

This should give you the maximum deflection at the free end. 

As for additional factors, make sure to consider any potential constraints or supports that might affect the beam's behavior, but the calculations should be straightforward based on the provided formulas.
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia formula for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's proceed with the correct moment of inertia calculation:

Given:
- Beam height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
- Beam width \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

Calculating the moment of inertia:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} \approx 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Substituting the values:

- \( F = 1 \, \text{kN} = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
- \( L = 1 \, \text{m} = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( E = 210 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)

Calculating the deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating further:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67} \approx \frac{10^9}{262500000000} \approx 0.00381 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately \( 3.81 \, \text{mm} \).

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 3.81 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon re-evaluating the calculations and formulas used, I can confirm that the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is correctly given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Now, let's summarize the calculations step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

1. **Given parameters**:
   - Load \( F = 1 \, \text{kN} = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
   - Length \( L = 1 \, \text{m} = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
   - Modulus of elasticity \( E = 210 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
   - Height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
   - Width \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

2. **Calculate the moment of inertia \( I \)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} \approx 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. **Calculate the maximum deflection \( \delta \)**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{262500000000} \approx 3.81 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately **3.81 mm**.
