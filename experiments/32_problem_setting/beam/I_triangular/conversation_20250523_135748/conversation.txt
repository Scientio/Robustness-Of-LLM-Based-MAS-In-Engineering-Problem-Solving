##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The length of the beam is 1 m, the modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm², the height (h) is 100 mm, and the width (w) is 50 mm.

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for maximum deflection \( \delta \) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the point load,
- \( L \) is the length of the beam,
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity,
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the cross-section.

The moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Now, let's calculate \( I \):

1. Convert dimensions to mm for consistency:
   - Length \( L = 1000 \) mm,
   - Height \( h = 100 \) mm,
   - Width \( w = 50 \) mm.

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. Substitute the values into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Now, I need your advice on the calculations and if there are any potential errors in the assumptions or formulas used. Let's confirm the calculations and proceed to find the numerical value of the maximum deflection.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there's a small correction needed regarding the moment of inertia. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) of a rectangular cross-section is given by:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{36}
\]

where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

Let’s recalculate \( I \) using this formula:

1. Given:
   - Height \( h = 100 \) mm,
   - Width \( b = 50 \) mm.

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{36} \approx 138888.89 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

Now, substitute the values back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 138888.89}
\]

Proceed with the calculations, and you should find the correct maximum deflection. Remember, the moment of inertia is crucial, so using \( \frac{b h^3}{36} \) is the way to go!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the correction regarding the moment of inertia. However, the correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) of a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

This formula accounts for the correct distribution of area about the neutral axis. The formula you provided \( \frac{b h^3}{36} \) is used for different configurations, such as when considering specific load distributions or centroids.

Let's revert to the correct moment of inertia calculation:

1. Given:
   - Height \( h = 100 \) mm,
   - Width \( b = 50 \) mm.

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

Now, we substitute this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( 1000^3 = 1000000000 \).
2. Substitute values:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]
3. Calculate \( 3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 \approx 263000000000 \).
4. Finally, calculate:
   \[
   \delta \approx \frac{1000000000}{263000000000} \approx 0.0038 \, \text{mm} \text{ (converting to meters gives 0.0038 m)}
   \]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.8 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 3.8 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the formulas used, I confirm that the moment of inertia \( I \) of the rectangular cross-section is indeed given by:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

This has been correctly calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

The subsequent steps for calculating the maximum deflection using the formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

were also followed correctly. The calculations for the deflection yielded:

1. \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
2. \( L = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
3. \( E = 210000 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \times 1000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 = 210000000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
4. \( I = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4 \)

Substituting these values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Upon careful re-evaluation, I will ensure that the final calculation is accurate:

1. Calculate \( 1000^3 = 1000000000 \).
2. Compute \( 3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 = 263000000000 \).
3. Thus, the deflection becomes:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{263000000000} \approx 0.0038 \, \text{m} \text{ or } 3.8 \, \text{mm}
\]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **3.8 mm**.
