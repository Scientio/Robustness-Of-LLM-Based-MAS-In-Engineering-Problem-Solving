Our parameters are:\n\n- Load (F) = 1 kN\n- Length (L) = 1 m\n- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm\u00b2\n- Height (h) = 100 mm\n- Width (w) = 50 mm\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section given by:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{w h^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( I \\) first:\n\n1.
