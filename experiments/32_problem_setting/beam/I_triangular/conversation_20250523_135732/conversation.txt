##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows: load F = 1 kN, length L = 1 m, modulus of elasticity E = 210 kN/mm², height h = 100 mm, and width w = 50 mm.

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F \cdot L^3}{3 \cdot E \cdot I}
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w \cdot h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \) first:

1. Convert dimensions to consistent units (mm):
   - L = 1000 mm
   - F = 1000 N (1 kN)
   - h = 100 mm
   - w = 50 mm

2. Calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \cdot (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \cdot 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

3. Now, substitute \( F \), \( L \), \( E \), and \( I \) into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \cdot (1000)^3}{3 \cdot 210000 \cdot 416666.67}
   \]

4. Calculate \( \delta \).

I would like your input on this approach and any suggestions for the calculations. Do you agree with the formula and the steps taken?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I believe there’s a small oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section should be:

\[
I = \frac{b \cdot h^3}{36}
\]

where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. So, let's recalculate \( I \) using this formula:

1. Given:
   - \( b = 50 \, mm \)
   - \( h = 100 \, mm \)

2. Calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \cdot (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \cdot 1000000}{36} \approx 138888.89 \, mm^4
   \]

Now, you can substitute this value of \( I \) into the deflection formula and proceed with the calculations. This adjustment will lead to a more accurate result for the maximum deflection \( \delta \).
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I must clarify that the formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{b \cdot h^3}{12}
\]

This formula accounts for the correct distribution of the area about the neutral axis. The formula you mentioned is not applicable here.

Let's stick with our original calculation for \( I \):

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \cdot (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \cdot 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

2. **Deflection Calculation**:
   Now, substituting this \( I \) value back into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \cdot (1000)^3}{3 \cdot 210000 \cdot 416666.67}
   \]

Calculating this gives:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \cdot 10^9}{3 \cdot 210000 \cdot 416666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:
\[
3 \cdot 210000 \cdot 416666.67 \approx 263888888.89
\]

Now, compute \( \delta \):
\[
\delta \approx \frac{1000000000}{263888888.89} \approx 3.79 \, mm
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.79 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
After re-evaluating the calculations and ensuring we used the correct formulas, the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam under the given load is approximately 3.79 mm. 

To summarize:

1. We confirmed that the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is indeed calculated using \( I = \frac{b \cdot h^3}{12} \).
2. The values were substituted correctly into the deflection formula for a cantilever beam under a point load.
3. The calculations yielded a maximum deflection of about 3.79 mm at the free end.

Final Decision: 3.79 mm.
