        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows: load F = 1 kN, length L = 1 m, modulus of elasticity E = 210 kN/mm\u00b2, height h = 100 mm, and width w = 50 mm.\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{F \\cdot L^3}{3 \\cdot E \\cdot I}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{w \\cdot h^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( I \\) first:\n\n1. Convert dimensions to consistent units (mm):\n   - L = 1000 mm\n   - F = 1000 N (1 kN)\n   - h = 100 mm\n   - w = 50 mm\n\n2. Calculate the moment of inertia \\( I \\):\n   \\[\n   I = \\frac{50 \\cdot (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\cdot 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \\, mm^4\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, substitute \\( F \\), \\( L \\), \\( E \\), and \\( I \\) into the deflection formula:\n   \\[\n   \\delta = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (1000)^3}{3 \\cdot 210000 \\cdot 416666.67}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate \\( \\delta \\).\n\nI would like your input on this approach and any suggestions for the calculations. Do you agree with the formula and the steps taken?"

The correct formula for the moment of inertia \\( I \\) for a rectangular cross-section should be:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{b \\cdot h^3}{36}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( b \\) is the width and \\( h \\) is the height. So, let's recalculate \\( I \\) using this formula:\n\n1. Given:\n   - \\( b = 50 \\, mm \\)\n   - \\( h = 100 \\, mm \\)\n\n2. Calculate the moment of inertia \\( I \\):\n   \\[\n   I = \\frac{50 \\cdot (100)^3}{36} = \\frac{50 \\cdot 1000000}{36} \\approx 138888.89 \\, mm^4\n   \\]\n\nNow, you can substitute this value of \\( I \\) into the deflection formula and proceed with the calculations. This adjustment will lead to a more accurate result for the maximum deflection \\( \\delta \\)."
