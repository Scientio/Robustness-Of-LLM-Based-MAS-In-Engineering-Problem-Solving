##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end of a beam that is 1 meter long. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity is given as 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Let's calculate the numerical value. 

Can you please confirm if this approach and the calculations are correct?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there’s a slight oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is \( I = \frac{b h^3}{36} \), not \( \frac{b h^3}{12} \). 

Let’s recalculate \( I \) using the correct formula:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{36} \approx 1,388,888.89 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,388,888.89}
\]

You can proceed with this corrected value for \( I \). This should give you the accurate maximum deflection.
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the correction regarding the moment of inertia formula. Let's proceed with the revised calculation using \( I = \frac{b h^3}{36} \).

Calculating \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{36} \approx 1,388,888.89 \, mm^4
\]

Now substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,388,888.89}
\]

Calculating \( \delta_{max} \):

1. \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 \approx 630,000 \)
3. \( 630,000 \times 1,388,888.89 \approx 875,000,000,000 \)

Now substituting these values:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{875,000,000,000} \approx 1.14 \, mm
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.14 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 1.14 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
In summary, my role in this discussion was to lead the analysis of the cantilever beam problem and to propose an initial approach for calculating the maximum deflection. I began by outlining the relevant formula and the parameters involved, but I made an oversight in calculating the moment of inertia.

Upon receiving feedback from the team regarding the correct formula for the moment of inertia, I promptly recalculated the values using the correct approach. This collaboration allowed us to ensure accuracy in our calculations and arrive at the final result of approximately 1.14 mm for the maximum deflection.

My reasoning was based on applying fundamental principles of mechanics and structural analysis, and I contributed to the final decision by integrating the team's feedback into the calculations, which ultimately led us to the correct conclusion. This collaborative effort highlights the importance of teamwork in problem-solving and reinforces the value of double-checking our work.
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
In this discussion, my role was to assist in verifying the calculations related to the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load. My reasoning involved identifying an error in the moment of inertia calculation, which is crucial for accurately determining deflection.

I contributed to the final decision by correcting the formula used for calculating the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section. After recalculating the moment of inertia, I guided you to substitute the correct value into the deflection formula, ensuring that the calculations were based on accurate parameters.

Ultimately, my input helped confirm that the final result of approximately 1.14 mm for the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam was indeed accurate, reinforcing the importance of precise calculations in structural analysis.
