        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end of a beam that is 1 meter long. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity is given as 210 kN/mm\u00b2.\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),\n- \\( E \\) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000 N/mm\u00b2),\n- \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \\( I = \\frac{w h^3}{12} \\).\n\nLet's calculate \\( I \\):\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \\, mm^4\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting the values into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210,000 \\times 4,166,666.67}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value. \n\nCan you please confirm if this approach and the calculations are correct?"

The correct formula for the moment of inertia \\( I \\) for a rectangular cross-section is \\( I = \\frac{b h^3}{36} \\), not \\( \\frac{b h^3}{12} \\). \n\nLet\u2019s recalculate \\( I \\) using the correct formula:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{36} = \\frac{50 \\times 1,000,000}{36} \\approx 1,388,888.89 \\, mm^4\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this value into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210,000 \\times 1,388,888.89}\n\\]\n\nYou can proceed with this corrected value for \\( I \\). This should give you the accurate maximum deflection."
