##### LEAD:
Team, we need to determine the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The given parameters are:

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Modulus of Elasticity (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

The formula for the maximum deflection (δ) at the free end of a cantilever beam under a point load is:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

First, we need to convert the units for consistency. Let's calculate \(I\):

1. Convert dimensions to mm:
   - L = 1000 mm
   - h = 100 mm
   - w = 50 mm

2. Calculate \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. Now, substitute values into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Let's compute this step by step. I would like to hear your thoughts on the calculations and if there are any concerns or alternative approaches.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, let's correct that moment of inertia calculation. The formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular section is actually:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{36}
\]

This is crucial for our deflection calculation. So, let's recalculate \(I\) using this formula:

1. Using the dimensions:
   - \(b = 50 \, \text{mm}\) (width)
   - \(h = 100 \, \text{mm}\) (height)

2. Calculate \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{36} \approx 138888.89 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

Now, substitute this into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 138888.89}
\]

This will lead us to the maximum deflection. Let’s proceed with the calculations, and I’m sure this approach will yield the correct results. What do you think?
##### LEAD:
I appreciate your input, but I must clarify that the formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

not \(\frac{b h^3}{36}\). Using the correct formula is crucial for accurate calculations.

Let's recalculate \(I\) using the correct formula:

1. Using the dimensions:
   - \(b = 50 \, \text{mm}\) (width)
   - \(h = 100 \, \text{mm}\) (height)

2. Calculate \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

Now we can use this value for \(I\) in the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Now, let's compute the maximum deflection using the correct moment of inertia. 

1. Calculate \(L^3\):
   \[
   L^3 = (1000)^3 = 1000000000 \, \text{mm}^3
   \]

2. Substitute into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

3. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 \approx 263000000000
   \]

4. Now calculate \(\delta\):
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000000000}{263000000000} \approx 0.0038 \, \text{mm} \approx 3.8 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.8 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the reasoning behind the deflection of the cantilever beam, I confirm that the moment of inertia \(I\) was correctly calculated using the formula:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

The subsequent calculations for the maximum deflection \(\delta\) also followed the correct procedure. To summarize:

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

2. **Deflection Formula**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]

3. **Substituting Values**:
   - \(F = 1000 \, \text{N}\)
   - \(L = 1000 \, \text{mm}\)
   - \(E = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2\)
   - \(I = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4\)

4. **Final Calculation**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67} \approx 3.8 \, \text{mm}
   \]

The calculations are consistent and align with the principles of mechanics of materials. 

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **3.8 mm**.
