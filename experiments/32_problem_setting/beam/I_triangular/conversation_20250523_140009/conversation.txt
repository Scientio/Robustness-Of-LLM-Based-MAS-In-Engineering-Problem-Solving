##### LEAD:
Team, we need to calculate the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a vertical point load at its free end. The parameters are as follows:

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

The formula for the maximum deflection (δ) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end is given by:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's first convert all units to consistent measurements, particularly for E, which we will convert to N/m². 

I would like your input on the calculations and whether we should proceed with these formulas. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, we should use the moment of inertia I as \( I = \frac{b h^3}{36} \) instead of \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \). This adjustment will give us a different value for I, which will impact our deflection calculation.

Let's proceed with the calculations using this formula. 

1. **Convert Young's Modulus**:
   - \( E = 210 \text{ kN/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^3 \text{ N/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 \)

2. **Calculate Moment of Inertia**:
   - Using \( b = 50 \text{ mm} \) and \( h = 100 \text{ mm} \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36}
   \]

3. **Calculate Maximum Deflection**:
   - Plugging values into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^9) \times I}
   \]

Make sure to carry out these calculations carefully, and let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
It's important to clarify that the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is indeed given by:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

The formula you suggested, \( I = \frac{b h^3}{36} \), is incorrect for this case. 

Let's proceed with the correct moment of inertia:

1. **Convert Young's Modulus**:
   - \( E = 210 \text{ kN/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^3 \text{ N/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 \)

2. **Calculate Moment of Inertia**:
   - Using \( b = 50 \text{ mm} \) and \( h = 100 \text{ mm} \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 10^6}{12} = 4.1667 \times 10^6 \text{ mm}^4
   \]

3. **Calculate Maximum Deflection**:
   - Convert the load \( F = 1 \text{ kN} = 1000 \text{ N} \) and length \( L = 1 \text{ m} = 1000 \text{ mm} \):
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^9) \times (4.1667 \times 10^6)}
   \]

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. \( (1000)^3 = 10^9 \)
2. \( 3 \times (210 \times 10^9) = 630 \times 10^9 \)
3. Substitute these values into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{630 \times 10^9 \times 4.1667 \times 10^6}
\]

Calculating this gives us the maximum deflection at the free end. 

Let’s finalize these calculations. 

1. \( 1000 \times 10^9 = 10^{12} \)
2. \( 630 \times 4.1667 \approx 2625.21 \)
3. Thus, \( \delta \approx \frac{10^{12}}{2625.21 \times 10^9} \approx 0.380 \text{ mm} \)

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.380 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
After reviewing the calculations and ensuring we used the correct moment of inertia formula, here’s a summary of the steps and the final result:

1. **Young's Modulus Conversion**:
   - \( E = 210 \text{ kN/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 \)

2. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   - For a rectangular cross-section:
   \[
   I = \frac{b h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 10^6}{12} = 4.1667 \times 10^6 \text{ mm}^4
   \]

3. **Maximum Deflection Calculation**:
   - Using the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   - Substituting values:
   - \( F = 1000 \text{ N} \)
   - \( L = 1000 \text{ mm} \)
   - \( I = 4.1667 \times 10^6 \text{ mm}^4 \)
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^9) \times (4.1667 \times 10^6)}
   \]

   - Calculating:
   - \( (1000)^3 = 10^9 \)
   - \( 3 \times (210 \times 10^9) = 630 \times 10^9 \)
   \[
   \delta = \frac{10^{12}}{630 \times 4.1667 \times 10^9} \approx \frac{10^{12}}{2625.21 \times 10^9} \approx 0.380 \text{ mm}
   \]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **0.380 mm**.
