##### LEAD:
Team, we need to determine the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a vertical point load at its free end. The beam has the following specifications: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To solve this, we can use the formula for the maximum deflection (\( \delta_{max} \)) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's first calculate \( I \):

1. Convert dimensions to consistent units (mm):
   - L = 1000 mm
   - h = 100 mm
   - w = 50 mm

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

3. Now substitute \( F \), \( L \), \( E \), and \( I \) into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210 \times 10^3 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Now, I need your input on the calculations and if there are any other considerations we should take into account. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, we should use the moment of inertia formula I = \(\frac{b h^3}{36}\) for a rectangular cross-section. This will give us a different result for \( I \).

Let’s recalculate \( I \) using this formula:

1. Using the given dimensions:
   - Width (b) = 50 mm
   - Height (h) = 100 mm

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{36} \approx 138888.89 \, mm^4
   \]

Now substitute this new \( I \) value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210 \times 10^3 \times 138888.89}
\]

This should lead us to the correct maximum deflection. Let me know if you need any further clarifications!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but the moment of inertia formula for a rectangular cross-section is indeed \( I = \frac{b h^3}{12} \), not \( \frac{b h^3}{36} \). 

Using \( I = \frac{b h^3}{12} \) is the correct approach for our calculations. Let's proceed with that value:

1. We already calculated \( I \):
   \[
   I = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

2. Now substituting into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210 \times 10^3 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Calculating \( \delta_{max} \):
- \( F = 1000 \, N \)
- \( L = 1000 \, mm \)
- \( E = 210 \times 10^3 \, N/mm^2 \)
- \( I = 416666.67 \, mm^4 \)

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210 \times 10^3 \times 416666.67} 
\]

Calculating this will yield the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam. 

Let's perform the final calculation to find the numerical value. 

\[
\delta_{max} \approx \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210 \times 10^3 \times 416666.67} 
\]

Calculating the denominator:
\[
3 \times 210 \times 10^3 \times 416666.67 \approx 263,000,000,000
\]

Now calculating \( \delta_{max} \):
\[
\delta_{max} \approx \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{263,000,000,000} \approx 3.8 \, mm
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.8 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and confirming the use of the correct moment of inertia formula for a rectangular cross-section, I can confidently state the following:

1. The moment of inertia \( I \) was calculated correctly using the formula \( I = \frac{b h^3}{12} \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

2. The formula for maximum deflection \( \delta_{max} \) was applied correctly:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]

3. The values substituted into the formula were accurate, leading to the calculation of the maximum deflection.

4. The final numerical value for maximum deflection was computed to be approximately 3.8 mm.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.8 mm.
