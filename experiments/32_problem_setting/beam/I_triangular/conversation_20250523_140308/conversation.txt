##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end of a beam that is 1 meter long. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity is given as 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

First, we calculate \( I \):
- \( w = 50 \) mm,
- \( h = 100 \) mm.

Now, let's calculate \( I \):
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = \frac{50,000,000}{12} \approx 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4.
\]

Now substituting the values into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}.
\]

Calculating \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \).

Now substituting:
\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}.
\]

Let's simplify this step-by-step. I would appreciate your thoughts on the calculations and if there are any adjustments needed. 

What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, it seems like there’s a small oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{36}
\]

where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

So, with your given dimensions:
- \( b = 50 \) mm,
- \( h = 100 \) mm.

Calculating \( I \) using the correct formula:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{36} \approx 1,388,889 \text{ mm}^4.
\]

Now substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,388,889}.
\]

So, you should use this adjusted \( I \) in your calculations. Let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input. However, I must clarify that the formula for the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is actually given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

This is the correct formula to use for our calculations. 

Let's proceed with the original calculation of \( I \):
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = \frac{50,000,000}{12} \approx 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4.
\]

Now substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}.
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \).
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,623,000,000 \).

Now substituting these values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{2,623,000,000}.
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\delta_{max} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,623,000,000} \approx 380.4 \text{ mm}.
\]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 380.4 mm.

Preliminary Decision: 380.4 mm. 

Please confirm if this aligns with your understanding or if you have further thoughts!
##### RETHINKING:
Upon re-evaluating the calculations and the formulas used, I realized that I made an error in the final calculation of deflection. Let's go through it again systematically.

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   Using the correct formula:
   \[
   I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = \frac{50,000,000}{12} \approx 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4.
   \]

2. **Deflection Formula**:
   The formula for maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load is:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:
   - \( F = 1000 \) N,
   - \( L = 1000 \) mm,
   - \( E = 210,000 \) N/mm²,
   - \( I \approx 4,166,667 \) mm⁴.

3. **Calculating Maximum Deflection**:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
   \]

   Breaking this down:
   - \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \).
   - \( 3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,623,000,000 \).

   Now substituting these values:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{2,623,000,000} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,623,000,000} \approx 380.4 \text{ mm}.
   \]

4. **Final Review**:
   The calculations appear consistent, and the correct formula for moment of inertia has been used. 

Final Decision: 380.4 mm.
