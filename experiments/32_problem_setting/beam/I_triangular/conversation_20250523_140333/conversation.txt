##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a point load at the free end. The parameters are as follows: 

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

We need to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam. 

The formula for the maximum deflection (δ) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end is given by:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where I (the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section) is calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's compute I first:

1. Convert units where necessary (E in N/mm², F in N, L in mm).
2. Substitute values into the deflection formula.

Can anyone confirm this approach or suggest any corrections?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section should be calculated using the formula:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{36}
\]

This is a crucial detail that will affect your calculations for the maximum deflection. 

Now, let's proceed with your calculations using this formula for \( I \). 

1. Convert the parameters:
   - \( F = 1 \, \text{kN} = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
   - \( L = 1 \, \text{m} = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
   - \( E = 210 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
   - \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
   - \( b = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{36} \approx 13888.89 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. Substitute values into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 13888.89}
   \]

This will give you the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam. Make sure to double-check the calculations and use the correct moment of inertia formula!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I believe there is a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia formula for a rectangular cross-section. The correct formula is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

So let's proceed with the calculations using the correct formula. 

1. Convert the parameters:
   - \( F = 1 \, \text{kN} = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
   - \( L = 1 \, \text{m} = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
   - \( E = 210 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
   - \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)
   - \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

2. Calculate \( I \):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} \approx 41666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. Substitute values into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 41666.67}
   \]

Now calculating \( \delta \):
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 41666.67} \approx \frac{1000000000}{26200000000} \approx 0.038 \, \text{mm} \text{ (approximately)}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.038 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and ensuring the correct formulas were used, I can confirm that the moment of inertia \( I \) for the rectangular cross-section was calculated correctly using:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

The parameters were converted appropriately, and the substitution into the deflection formula was executed correctly. The final calculation for the maximum deflection \( \delta \) at the free end of the cantilever beam yields approximately:

\[
\delta \approx 0.038 \, \text{mm}
\]

This value appears consistent with the application of the relevant formulas and conversion of units. 

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.038 mm.

Ultimately, I contributed to the final decision by calculating the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam, which was determined to be approximately 0.038 mm. This collaborative effort highlighted the importance of accuracy in formula usage and the value of team input in engineering calculations.
