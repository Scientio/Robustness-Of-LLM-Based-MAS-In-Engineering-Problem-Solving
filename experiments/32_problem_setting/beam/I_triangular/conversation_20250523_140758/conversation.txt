##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam length is 1 m, with a modulus of elasticity (E) of 210 kN/mm², a height (h) of 100 mm, and a width (w) of 50 mm.

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for maximum deflection (\( \delta_{max} \)) of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the cross-section, calculated as \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

First, let's calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now we can substitute these values into the deflection formula. I would like your input on proceeding with these calculations and if there are any considerations we should take into account. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like you made a small error in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is actually \( I = \frac{b h^3}{36} \), not \( \frac{w h^3}{12} \). 

So, let's recalculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{36} \approx 1,388,888.89 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 1,388,888.89}
\]

Proceed with these calculations, and let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Actually, the moment of inertia formula for a rectangular cross-section is indeed \( I = \frac{b h^3}{12} \), not \( \frac{b h^3}{36} \). The correct calculation should remain as follows:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, using this value in the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
\]

Calculating the deflection step-by-step:

1. \( F \times L^3 = 1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 1,000,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 \, N \cdot mm^3 \)
2. \( 3 \times E \times I = 3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67 \approx 2,628,000,000,000 \, N \cdot mm^2 \)

Now, substituting these values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.38 \, mm
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.38 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.38 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and reasoning, I see that I made a mistake in the final numerical evaluations. Let me clarify the calculations step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   \[
   I = \frac{b h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

2. **Substituting Values into the Deflection Formula**:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   Where:
   - \( F = 1000 \, N \)
   - \( L = 1000 \, mm \)
   - \( E = 210,000 \, N/mm^2 \)
   - \( I = 4,166,666.67 \, mm^4 \)

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Numerator**:
   \[
   1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 1,000,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 \, N \cdot mm^3
   \]

4. **Calculating the Denominator**:
   \[
   3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,666.67 \approx 2,628,000,000,000 \, N \cdot mm^2
   \]

5. **Final Calculation for Maximum Deflection**:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.38 \, mm
   \]

After reviewing the calculations, the maximum deflection at the free end is indeed approximately 0.38 mm.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.38 mm.
