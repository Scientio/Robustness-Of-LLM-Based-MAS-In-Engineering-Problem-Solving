##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a vertical point load at the free end. We need to calculate the maximum deflection at that point. The parameters are as follows:

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection (δ) at the free end, we can use the formula for a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Now, let’s calculate \(I\) first:

1. Convert the dimensions to consistent units (mm):
   - L = 1000 mm
   - h = 100 mm
   - w = 50 mm

2. Calculate \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

3. Now substituting values into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Let’s calculate this value step by step. I would like your input on the calculations and if you see any potential issues or alternative methods to approach this problem.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I believe there's a slight oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula to use for the moment of inertia \(I\) of a rectangular cross-section is:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{36}
\]

This is crucial for our calculations. Let's recalculate \(I\) with this formula:

1. Using \(b = 50 \, \text{mm}\) and \(h = 100 \, \text{mm}\):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{36} \approx 138888.89 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

2. Now substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 138888.89}
\]

3. This will give us the new maximum deflection value.

Please proceed with these calculations and let me know if you encounter any discrepancies!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia calculation for a rectangular cross-section should indeed use the formula:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

This is the standard formula for calculating the moment of inertia for a rectangle about its base. The formula you mentioned, \(I = \frac{b h^3}{36}\), is typically used for a different axis or context.

Let’s proceed with the correct calculation using:

1. Moment of inertia \(I\):
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

2. Now substituting this back into the deflection formula:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

Calculating:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000}{3 \times 87500000} \approx \frac{1000000000}{262500000} \approx 3.81 \, \text{mm}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.81 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
After reviewing the calculations and confirming the use of the correct moment of inertia formula for a rectangular cross-section, we have established the following:

1. The moment of inertia \(I\) was calculated using the correct formula:
   \[
   I = \frac{b h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

2. The maximum deflection \(\delta\) at the free end was calculated using the formula for a cantilever beam under a point load:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]

3. Substituting the values:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
   \]

4. The resulting value for the maximum deflection was found to be approximately 3.81 mm.

Final Decision: 3.81 mm.
