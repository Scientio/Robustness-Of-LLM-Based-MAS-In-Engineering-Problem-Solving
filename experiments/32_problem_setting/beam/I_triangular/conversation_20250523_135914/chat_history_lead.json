        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam with a vertical point load at the free end. We need to calculate the maximum deflection at that point. The parameters are as follows:\n\n- Load (F) = 1 kN\n- Length (L) = 1 m\n- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm\u00b2\n- Height (h) = 100 mm\n- Width (w) = 50 mm\n\nTo find the maximum deflection (\u03b4) at the free end, we can use the formula for a cantilever beam under a point load:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(I\\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{w h^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nNow, let\u2019s calculate \\(I\\) first:\n\n1. Convert the dimensions to consistent units (mm):\n   - L = 1000 mm\n   - h = 100 mm\n   - w = 50 mm\n\n2. Calculate \\(I\\):\n   \\[\n   I = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \\, \\text{mm}^4\n   \\]\n\n3.

I would like your input on the calculations and if you see any potential issues or alternative methods to approach this problem."

The correct formula to use for the moment of inertia \\(I\\) of a rectangular cross-section is:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{b h^3}{36}\n\\]\n\nThis is crucial for our calculations. Let's recalculate \\(I\\) with this formula:\n\n1. Using \\(b = 50 \\, \\text{mm}\\) and \\(h = 100 \\, \\text{mm}\\):\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{36} = \\frac{50 \\times 1000000}{36} \\approx 138888.89 \\, \\text{mm}^4\n\\]\n\n2.
