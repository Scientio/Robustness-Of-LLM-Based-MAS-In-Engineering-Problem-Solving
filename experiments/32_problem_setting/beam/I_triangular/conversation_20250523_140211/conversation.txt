##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end of a beam with a length of 1 m, height of 100 mm, and width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity is given as 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F \cdot L^3}{3 \cdot E \cdot I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N)
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm)
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²)
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( I = \frac{w \cdot h^3}{12} \)

Calculating \( I \):
\[
I = \frac{50 \cdot (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \cdot 1,000,000}{12} = \frac{50,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now substituting into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \cdot (1000)^3}{3 \cdot 210,000 \cdot 4,166,666.67}
\]

Let's compute this value. I would like your input on the calculations and any potential considerations we should keep in mind. 

What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, the moment of inertia \( I \) should be calculated using the formula \( I = \frac{b \cdot h^3}{36} \) instead of \( I = \frac{w \cdot h^3}{12} \). This will give us a different value for \( I \) and subsequently affect our deflection calculation.

Let's recalculate \( I \) using the correct formula:

\[
I = \frac{50 \cdot (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \cdot 1,000,000}{36} = \frac{50,000,000}{36} \approx 1,388,888.89 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now substituting this into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \cdot (1000)^3}{3 \cdot 210,000 \cdot 1,388,888.89}
\]

This will yield a different deflection value. Make sure to use this new moment of inertia for your calculations. Let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is indeed given by \( I = \frac{b \cdot h^3}{12} \), not \( \frac{b \cdot h^3}{36} \). The \( \frac{1}{36} \) factor applies to a different case, such as calculating the moment of inertia about a different axis.

Let's proceed with the correct moment of inertia calculation:

\[
I = \frac{50 \cdot (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \cdot 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \cdot (1000)^3}{3 \cdot 210,000 \cdot 4,166,666.67}
\]

Calculating it step by step:

1. Calculate \( (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \).
2. Calculate \( 3 \cdot 210,000 \cdot 4,166,666.67 \).

Now we can compute:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \cdot 1,000,000,000}{3 \cdot 210,000 \cdot 4,166,666.67}
\]

Let's simplify this calculation:

\[
\delta = \frac{1,000,000,000}{3 \cdot 210,000 \cdot 4,166,666.67} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000} \approx 0.380 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.380 mm.

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.380 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon re-evaluating the calculations and the reasoning behind the problem, I can confirm that the moment of inertia \( I \) was calculated correctly using the formula \( I = \frac{b \cdot h^3}{12} \) for a rectangular cross-section. 

The steps taken to derive the maximum deflection \( \delta \) at the free end of the cantilever beam were as follows:

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation:**
   \[
   I = \frac{50 \cdot (100)^3}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
   \]

2. **Deflection Formula:**
   \[
   \delta = \frac{F \cdot L^3}{3 \cdot E \cdot I}
   \]

3. **Substituting Values:**
   - \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
   - \( L = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
   - \( E = 210,000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
   - \( I = 4,166,666.67 \, \text{mm}^4 \)

4. **Final Calculation:**
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \cdot (1000)^3}{3 \cdot 210,000 \cdot 4,166,666.67} \approx 0.380 \, \text{mm}
   \]

After reviewing the calculations and confirming the use of the correct formulas, I find that the derived deflection value is consistent with the principles of mechanics.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.380 mm.
