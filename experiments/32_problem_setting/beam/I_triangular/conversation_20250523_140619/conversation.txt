##### LEAD:
Team, we need to determine the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. Given parameters are:

- Load, F = 1 kN
- Length, L = 1 m
- Modulus of Elasticity, E = 210 kN/mm²
- Height, h = 100 mm
- Width, w = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

First, we need to convert our units to consistent ones. Since \( E \) is in kN/mm², we should convert \( F \) and \( L \) accordingly. 

Let's calculate \( I \):
- \( w = 50 \) mm
- \( h = 100 \) mm

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Next, we convert \( F \) to N:
- \( F = 1 \, kN = 1000 \, N \)
- \( E = 210 \, kN/mm^2 = 210 \times 10^3 \, N/mm^2 \)

Now, substituting values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 416666.67}
\]

Now, let's calculate this value. 

Team, please check the calculations and confirm if we are on the right track or if there are any adjustments needed.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there's a small mistake in the moment of inertia formula you've used. The correct moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular section should be:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{36}
\]

where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

Let's recalculate \( I \) using the correct formula:

- \( b = 50 \) mm
- \( h = 100 \) mm

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{36} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{36} \approx 138888.89 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 138888.89}
\]

Proceed with the calculations using this updated moment of inertia. This should give you the correct maximum deflection. Let me know if you need further clarification!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but the moment of inertia formula you've provided is incorrect. The moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed given by:

\[
I = \frac{b h^3}{12}
\]

where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

Let's use the correct value of \( I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} \) which we calculated previously as \( 416666.67 \, mm^4 \).

Now, substituting this back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating the maximum deflection step-by-step:

1. \( F = 1000 \, N \)
2. \( L = 1000 \, mm \)
3. \( E = 210 \times 10^3 \, N/mm^2 \)
4. \( I = 416666.67 \, mm^4 \)

Now substituting these values:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 416666.67}
\]
\[
= \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]
\[
= \frac{1000000000}{3 \times 87500000}
\]
\[
= \frac{1000000000}{262500000} \approx 3.81 \, mm
\]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately \( 3.81 \, mm \).

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection is approximately 3.81 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and reasoning, it appears that the steps taken to determine the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam are correct. The moment of inertia was calculated accurately using the correct formula, and the substitution into the deflection formula was performed correctly.

The final result, which indicates that the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 3.81 mm, seems consistent with the given parameters and formulas.

Final Decision: 3.81 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
In summary, my role in this discussion was to analyze the problem of maximum deflection in a cantilever beam under a point load and to guide the team through the calculations. I initially presented the relevant formulas and performed calculations based on the provided parameters. 

When a team member pointed out a potential error in the moment of inertia formula, I clarified that the correct formula is \( I = \frac{b h^3}{12} \) for a rectangular cross-section. I recalculated the moment of inertia and then substituted it back into the deflection formula, ensuring that all units were consistent throughout the process.

Ultimately, my contribution led to the final decision that the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam is approximately 3.81 mm. I encouraged the team to verify the calculations and provided clarification where needed, fostering a collaborative approach to problem-solving.
