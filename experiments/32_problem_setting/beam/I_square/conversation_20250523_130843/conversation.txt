##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end of a beam that is 1 meter long. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F \cdot L^3}{3 \cdot E \cdot I}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity,
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section.

For a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:

\[
I = \frac{w \cdot h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \) first:

- \( w = 50 \text{ mm} = 0.05 \text{ m} \)
- \( h = 100 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \text{ m} \)

Now, substituting these values into the moment of inertia formula:

\[
I = \frac{0.05 \cdot (0.1)^3}{12} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.001}{12} = \frac{0.00005}{12} \approx 4.17 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4
\]

Now, converting \( E \) to consistent units:

\[
E = 210 \text{ kN/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^3 \text{ N/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2
\]

Now, substituting all values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \text{ N} \cdot (1)^3}{3 \cdot (210 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.17 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

Calculating this gives us the maximum deflection. 

I would like to hear your advice on this approach and if there's anything I might have overlooked.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think there's a slight oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. For a rectangular cross-section, I should have pointed out that the correct formula is:

\[
I = \frac{h^4}{12}
\]

Given the height \( h = 100 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \text{ m} \), we can calculate:

\[
I = \frac{(0.1)^4}{12} = \frac{0.0001}{12} \approx 8.33 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4
\]

This value will significantly affect the maximum deflection calculation. Please use this corrected moment of inertia in your deflection formula. Let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia formula for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w \cdot h^3}{12}
\]

where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. The correct calculation should be:

\[
I = \frac{50 \text{ mm} \cdot (100 \text{ mm})^3}{12} = \frac{50 \cdot 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4 = 4.16667 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^4
\]

Given this value, we can now proceed with the deflection calculation using:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F \cdot L^3}{3 \cdot E \cdot I}
\]

Substituting the values:

- \( F = 1000 \text{ N} \)
- \( L = 1 \text{ m} \)
- \( E = 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 \)
- \( I = 4.16667 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^4 \)

Now we can calculate:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \cdot (1)^3}{3 \cdot (210 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.16667 \times 10^{-3})}
\]

Calculating this will give us the maximum deflection at the free end. 

Let’s proceed with this calculation to find the numerical value. 

Preliminary Decision: \(\delta_{max} \approx 0.00036 \text{ m} \) or \( 0.36 \text{ mm} \).
##### RETHINKING:
Let's finalize the calculation for the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam using the correct values.

Using the formula for maximum deflection:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F \cdot L^3}{3 \cdot E \cdot I}
\]

We have:

- \( F = 1000 \text{ N} \)
- \( L = 1 \text{ m} \)
- \( E = 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2 \)
- \( I = 4.16667 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^4 \)

Now substituting these values into the equation:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \cdot (1)^3}{3 \cdot (210 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.16667 \times 10^{-3})}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \cdot (210 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.16667 \times 10^{-3}) = 3 \cdot 210 \cdot 4.16667 \cdot 10^6 \approx 2630.5 \times 10^6 \text{ N}
\]

Now, substituting this back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000}{2630.5 \times 10^6}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\delta_{max} \approx 3.8 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} = 0.38 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **0.38 mm**.

Final Decision: **0.38 mm**.
