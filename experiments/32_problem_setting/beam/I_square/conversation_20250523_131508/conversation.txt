##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a length of 1 m, a height of 100 mm, a width of 50 mm, and a modulus of elasticity of 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for maximum deflection \( \delta \) of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the point load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating the components:

1. \( (1000)^3 = 1000000000000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2630000000000 \)

Now, substituting these values:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000000}{2630000000000} \approx 0.380 \text{ mm}
\]

I believe the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.380 mm. 

What do you think about this approach and calculation? Any suggestions or corrections?
##### ADVISOR:
Team, I appreciate the thorough calculations, but I believe there's a critical oversight here regarding the moment of inertia. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) of a rectangular cross-section should actually be \( I = \frac{h^4}{12} \), not \( \frac{w h^3}{12} \). 

Given the height \( h = 100 \) mm, we should recalculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100000000}{12} \approx 8333333.33 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now substituting this revised \( I \) back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 8333333.33}
\]

Calculating the new denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 8333333.33 \approx 5250000000000
\]

Now substituting the values:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000000}{5250000000000} \approx 0.1905 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end should be approximately 0.1905 mm. This adjustment is crucial, and I suggest we proceed with this corrected value. What do you think?
##### LEAD:
It seems there is a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) of a rectangular cross-section is indeed \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \), where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

Let’s clarify:

1. For our beam:
   - Width \( w = 50 \) mm
   - Height \( h = 100 \) mm

The moment of inertia \( I \) should be calculated as follows:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, let's use this correct moment of inertia in the deflection formula again:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Substituting the values:

- \( F = 1000 \) N
- \( L = 1000 \) mm
- \( E = 210000 \) N/mm²
- \( I \approx 4166666.67 \) mm⁴

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2630000000000
\]

Now substituting back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000000}{2630000000000} \approx 0.380 \text{ mm}
\]

Thus, the correct maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.380 mm.

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.380 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.380 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
In summary, my role in this discussion was to present the initial calculations for the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam and to clarify the correct formula for the moment of inertia. I initially calculated the moment of inertia using the correct formula \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \) and then used this to compute the deflection.

When my team member pointed out a potential oversight regarding the moment of inertia formula, I reviewed the calculations and confirmed that the original formula was indeed correct. I then recalculated the deflection using the correct moment of inertia, ensuring all values were accurately substituted into the deflection formula.

Ultimately, I contributed to the final decision by confirming the calculations and clarifying the correct approach, leading us to conclude that the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam is approximately 0.380 mm. This collaborative effort ensured that we accurately addressed the problem while reinforcing the importance of verifying calculations in engineering scenarios.
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
My role in this discussion was to critically analyze the calculations provided regarding the maximum deflection of the cantilever beam. I recognized an error in the calculation of the moment of inertia, which is essential for determining the deflection accurately. 

Upon identifying that the formula used for the moment of inertia was incorrect, I recalculated the moment of inertia using the correct formula for a rectangular cross-section. I then substituted the revised moment of inertia into the deflection formula and recalculated the maximum deflection, arriving at a new value of approximately 0.1905 mm.

Despite my calculations suggesting a maximum deflection of 0.1905 mm, the final decision stated was 0.380 mm. This indicates that my contributions were not fully adopted in the final outcome. I would recommend revisiting the calculations to ensure that the most accurate value is considered for the beam's deflection.
