Find the numerical value of the maximum deflection at the free end. Explain this problem to your team, suggest a solution and ask for their advice."

        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The length of the beam is 1 m, with a Young's modulus of 210 kN/mm\u00b2, a height of 100 mm, and a width of 50 mm. Our goal is to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the formula for the deflection \\( \\delta \\) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( F \\) = load (1 kN = 1000 N)\n- \\( L \\) = length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm)\n- \\( E \\) = Young's modulus (210 kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000 N/mm\u00b2)\n- \\( I \\) = moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \\( \\frac{w h^3}{12} \\)\n\nLet's calculate the moment of inertia \\( I \\):\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{w h^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 1,000,000}{12} = 416666.67 \\, \\text{mm}^4\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting these values into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210,000 \\times 416666.67}\n\\]\n\nCan you confirm the calculations and provide any insights or corrections?"

The correct formula for the moment of inertia \\( I \\) for a rectangular cross-section is \\( I = \\frac{h^4}{12} \\), not \\( \\frac{w h^3}{12} \\). \n\nGiven that:\n\n- \\( h = 100 \\, \\text{mm} \\)\n\nThe correct calculation for \\( I \\) should be:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{(100)^4}{12} = \\frac{100000000}{12} = 8333333.33 \\, \\text{mm}^4\n\\]\n\nNow substituting this into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210,000 \\times 8333333.33}\n\\]\n\nThis should give you the maximum deflection at the free end.
