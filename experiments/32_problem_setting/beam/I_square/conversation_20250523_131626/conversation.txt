##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The length of the beam is 1 m, with a Young's modulus of 210 kN/mm², a height of 100 mm, and a width of 50 mm. Our goal is to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end.

To solve this, we can use the formula for the deflection \( \delta \) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) = load (1 kN = 1000 N)
- \( L \) = length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm)
- \( E \) = Young's modulus (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²)
- \( I \) = moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( \frac{w h^3}{12} \)

Let's calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 416666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting these values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Can you confirm the calculations and provide any insights or corrections?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there's a small error in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is \( I = \frac{h^4}{12} \), not \( \frac{w h^3}{12} \). 

Given that:

- \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)

The correct calculation for \( I \) should be:

\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100000000}{12} = 8333333.33 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now substituting this into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 8333333.33}
\]

This should give you the maximum deflection at the free end. Make sure to double-check the numbers for accuracy!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for the clarification on the moment of inertia calculation. Let's correct that and proceed with the calculations.

Using the corrected moment of inertia \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100,000,000}{12} = 8,333,333.33 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 8,333,333.33}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1000 \times 1,000,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 \, \text{N mm}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210,000 \times 8,333,333.33 = 5,250,000,000,000 \, \text{N mm}
\]

Now, substituting these into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{5,250,000,000,000} \approx 0.1905 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.1905 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.1905 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.1905 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
To summarize my role in this discussion, I served as the facilitator and problem solver for the cantilever beam deflection calculation. My initial approach included outlining the relevant formula for deflection and attempting to calculate the moment of inertia for the beam's cross-section.

Upon receiving feedback from the team regarding an error in the moment of inertia formula, I acknowledged the correction and recalculated the moment of inertia using the correct formula \( I = \frac{h^4}{12} \). I then proceeded to substitute this corrected value into the deflection formula, ensuring all calculations were accurate.

My reasoning involved breaking down the problem into manageable steps, validating the calculations, and incorporating team feedback to arrive at the final solution. Ultimately, my contribution led to the accurate determination of the maximum deflection, which is a crucial outcome for understanding the beam's performance under load.
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
In this discussion, my role was to assist in verifying the calculations related to the deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load. I focused on ensuring the accuracy of the moment of inertia calculation and the overall deflection formula application.

My reasoning involved identifying an error in the initial moment of inertia formula used, which was incorrectly stated. I clarified that the correct moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section should be calculated using \( I = \frac{h^4}{12} \) rather than \( \frac{w h^3}{12} \). This was crucial because the moment of inertia directly impacts the deflection calculation.

I contributed to the final decision by providing the corrected moment of inertia value and guiding the substitution of this value into the deflection formula. By ensuring the calculations were accurate, we arrived at the conclusion that the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.1905 mm. This collaborative effort ensured that the calculations were robust and reliable for engineering applications.
