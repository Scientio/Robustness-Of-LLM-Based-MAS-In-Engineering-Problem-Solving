##### LEAD:
Team, we need to determine the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. 

Given:
- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

The formula for maximum deflection (δ) of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end is given by:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, calculated as \(I = \frac{w h^3}{12}\).

Let's first calculate the moment of inertia:

1. Convert units for consistency:
   - F = 1 kN = 1000 N
   - L = 1 m = 1000 mm
   - E = 210 kN/mm² = 210 x 10^3 N/mm²
   - h = 100 mm
   - w = 50 mm

2. Calculate \(I\):
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

3. Substitute values into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 416666.67}
\]

Now, let's compute this.

Can anyone assist with the calculations or provide insights on this approach?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think there's a slight misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia for the beam. The correct expression for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section should be \(I = \frac{h^4}{12}\), not \(\frac{w h^3}{12}\). 

So, let's recalculate \(I\) using the height \(h\):

1. Calculate \(I\):
\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100000000}{12} = 8333333.33 \, mm^4
\]

2. Substitute this value into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 8333333.33}
\]

Now, you can proceed with the calculations using this new moment of inertia. Let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section. The correct formula is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \(w\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. The height is raised to the third power because it contributes more significantly to the beam's resistance to bending.

So, let's clarify our calculations:

1. **Calculate \(I\)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
   \]

2. **Now substitute this value into the deflection formula**:
   \[
   \delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 416666.67}
   \]

Now, let's compute the deflection:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- Numerator: \(1000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000\)
- Denominator: \(3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 \approx 263000000000\)

Thus, 

\[
\delta \approx \frac{1000000000000}{263000000000} \approx 3.8 \, mm
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **3.8 mm**.
##### RETHINKING:
After reviewing the calculations and the reasoning behind the moment of inertia, I can confirm that the correct expression for the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

With \(w = 50 \, mm\) and \(h = 100 \, mm\), we calculated \(I\) correctly as:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^3) \times 416666.67}
\]

After performing the calculations step by step, we found that the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately:

\[
\delta \approx 3.8 \, mm
\]

Final Decision: **The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.8 mm.**
