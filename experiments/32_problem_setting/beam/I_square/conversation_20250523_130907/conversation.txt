##### LEAD:
Team, we need to determine the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a vertical point load at the free end. The given parameters are:

- Load (F) = 1 kN
- Length (L) = 1 m
- Young's Modulus (E) = 210 kN/mm²
- Height (h) = 100 mm
- Width (w) = 50 mm

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \(I\) first:

1. Convert units:
   - \(w = 50 \text{ mm} = 0.05 \text{ m}\)
   - \(h = 100 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \text{ m}\)
   - \(E = 210 \text{ kN/mm}^2 = 210 \times 10^6 \text{ kN/m}^2\)

2. Calculate \(I\):
\[
I = \frac{0.05 \times (0.1)^3}{12} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.001}{12} = \frac{0.00005}{12} \approx 4.167 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4
\]

3. Now, substitute into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^6) \times (4.167 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

Calculating this gives us the maximum deflection. I would like your input on the calculations and if there are any adjustments or alternative methods we should consider.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there's a crucial detail about the moment of inertia \(I\) that needs to be corrected. For a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia should be calculated using the formula:

\[
I = \frac{h^4}{12}
\]

This is the correct expression for the moment of inertia of a beam with height \(h\). 

Let's recalculate \(I\) using this formula:

1. Given \(h = 100 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \text{ m}\):

\[
I = \frac{(0.1)^4}{12} = \frac{0.0001}{12} \approx 8.333 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4
\]

2. Now substitute this into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^6) \times (8.333 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

This will yield the maximum deflection. It's important to ensure that we're using the correct moment of inertia to get an accurate result. Please proceed with this calculation and let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular beam is:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \(w\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. 

Let's confirm the calculations using the correct formula:

1. Given:
   - Width \(w = 50 \text{ mm} = 0.05 \text{ m}\)
   - Height \(h = 100 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \text{ m}\)

2. Calculate \(I\):
\[
I = \frac{0.05 \times (0.1)^3}{12} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.001}{12} = \frac{0.00005}{12} \approx 4.167 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4
\]

3. Now, substitute this \(I\) value into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^6) \times (4.167 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

Calculating this will yield the maximum deflection. Let's proceed with this calculation:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000}{3 \times 210 \times 10^6 \times 4.167 \times 10^{-6}} 
\]

\[
= \frac{1000}{3 \times 210 \times 4.167} \approx \frac{1000}{2616.87} \approx 0.382 \text{ mm}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.382 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the moment of inertia formula, it appears that the original formula I provided for the moment of inertia was indeed correct for a rectangular cross-section beam. The moment of inertia \(I\) should be calculated using:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Given the parameters:

- Width \(w = 50 \text{ mm} = 0.05 \text{ m}\)
- Height \(h = 100 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \text{ m}\)

Calculating \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{0.05 \times (0.1)^3}{12} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.001}{12} = \frac{0.00005}{12} \approx 4.167 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4
\]

Now substituting this \(I\) value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:

- \(F = 1000 \text{ N}\)
- \(L = 1 \text{ m}\)
- \(E = 210 \times 10^9 \text{ N/m}^2\) (converting from kN/mm² to N/m²)

Substituting in the values:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1)^3}{3 \times (210 \times 10^9) \times (4.167 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
= \frac{1000}{3 \times 210 \times 4.167 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^9}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210 \times 4.167 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^9 \approx 2.617 \times 10^3
\]

Finally, calculating the maximum deflection:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000}{2617} \approx 0.382 \text{ mm}
\]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.382 mm.
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
To summarize my role in the discussion regarding the cantilever beam problem, I initially presented the approach to calculate the maximum deflection using the appropriate formula for a cantilever beam subjected to a point load. I explained the parameters involved and the necessary steps to arrive at the solution.

When a correction was suggested regarding the moment of inertia, I clarified that the formula I provided was indeed correct for a rectangular cross-section:

I then recalculated the moment of inertia using the correct dimensions and proceeded to apply it to the deflection formula. I ensured to convert units appropriately and calculated the maximum deflection step by step, arriving at the final value of approximately 0.382 mm.

In this process, I contributed by verifying the calculations, clarifying misunderstandings, and guiding the team towards the correct conclusion based on established engineering principles.
