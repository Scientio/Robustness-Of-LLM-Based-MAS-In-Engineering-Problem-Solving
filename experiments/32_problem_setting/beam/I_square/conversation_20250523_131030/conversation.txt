##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam's dimensions are 1 m in length, 100 mm in height, and 50 mm in width. The modulus of elasticity is 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, we can substitute the values into the deflection formula. 

I would like your advice on the calculations and if there are any potential errors we should watch for. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like there’s a small error in your moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for a rectangular cross-section is actually \( I = \frac{h^4}{12} \), not \( \frac{w h^3}{12} \). 

Given your height \( h = 100 \, mm \):

\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100000000}{12} = 8333333.33 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 8333333.33}
\]

Make sure to double-check your calculations with this corrected moment of inertia. Let me know if you need further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I believe there is a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia formula. For a rectangular cross-section, the correct formula is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Given our beam dimensions:
- Width \( w = 50 \, mm \)
- Height \( h = 100 \, mm \)

The moment of inertia should be calculated as follows:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting the correct values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating this gives us:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 10^9}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Let's compute this step by step:

1. Calculate \( 3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 \):
   \[
   3 \times 210000 = 630000
   \]
   \[
   630000 \times 416666.67 \approx 262500000000
   \]

2. Now substitute back:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000000000}{262500000000} \approx 0.0038 \, mm
   \]

This seems quite small, so let’s finalize our calculations for confirmation. 

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.0038 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
After reviewing the calculations and confirming the values used, I realize there was a mistake in the final numerical calculations. Let's go through the calculations again carefully.

We have:
- Load \( F = 1000 \, N \)
- Length \( L = 1000 \, mm \)
- Modulus of elasticity \( E = 210000 \, N/mm^2 \)
- Moment of inertia \( I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4 \)

Now substituting into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating \( L^3 \):

\[
(1000)^3 = 1000000000 \, mm^3
\]

Now substituting back into the equation:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67 = 263250000000
\]

Now substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000000000}{263250000000} \approx 0.0038 \, mm
\]

However, let's ensure we do the division correctly:

\[
\delta_{max} \approx \frac{1000 \times 1000000000}{263250000000} \approx 0.0038 \, mm
\]

Upon further checking, I see that the calculated maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is indeed approximately 0.0038 mm.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.0038 mm.
