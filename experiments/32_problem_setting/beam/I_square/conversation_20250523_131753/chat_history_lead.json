        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The length of the beam is 1 m, the modulus of elasticity E is 210 kN/mm\u00b2, the height h is 100 mm, and the width w is 50 mm. \n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),\n- \\( E \\) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000 N/mm\u00b2),\n- \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by \\( I = \\frac{w h^3}{12} \\).\n\nCalculating \\( I \\):\n\\[\nI = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \\, \\text{mm}^4\n\\]\n\nNow substituting the values into the deflection formula:\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210,000 \\times 4,166,666.67}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute this value. What do you think about this approach? Do you have any suggestions or concerns?"
