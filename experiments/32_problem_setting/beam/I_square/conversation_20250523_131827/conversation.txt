##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end of a beam that is 1 m long. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity is 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

where:
- \( \delta \) is the deflection,
- \( F \) is the point load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, given by:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating \( \delta \) will give us the maximum deflection. 

Team, based on this approach, do you have any suggestions or concerns about the calculations or the formula used?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I believe there's a slight oversight in the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section should be \( I = \frac{h^4}{12} \). 

So, with \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \):

\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100000000}{12} \approx 8333333.33 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Using this value in the deflection formula should yield a different result for \( \delta \). Please proceed with this revised moment of inertia and let me know what you find!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but it seems there is a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia calculation for a rectangular cross-section. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) of a rectangular beam is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

Using the correct parameters:
- Width \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)

The calculation for \( I \) should be:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = \frac{50000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating \( \delta \):

1. Calculate \( (1000)^3 = 1000000000000 \)
2. Calculate \( 3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2632500000000 \)

Now substituting these values:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000000}{2632500000000} \approx 379.45 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 379.45 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 379.45 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
After reviewing the calculations and the moment of inertia formula, I realize that the earlier calculations were correct based on the proper formula for the moment of inertia of a rectangular cross-section. The correct formula is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Given:
- Width \( w = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Height \( h = 100 \, \text{mm} \)

The moment of inertia \( I \) was calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} \approx 4166666.67 \, \text{mm}^4
\]

Using this value in the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Substituting:
- \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
- \( L = 1000 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( E = 210000 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)

The calculation proceeds as follows:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67}
\]

Calculating the values:
1. \( (1000)^3 = 1000000000000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210000 \times 4166666.67 \approx 2632500000000 \)

Thus:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000000}{2632500000000} \approx 379.45 \, \text{mm}
\]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 379.45 mm.
