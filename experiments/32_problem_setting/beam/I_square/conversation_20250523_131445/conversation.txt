##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end of a beam that is 1 m long. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity (E) is given as 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \(F\) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \(L\) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \(E\) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \(I\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \(I = \frac{w h^3}{12}\).

Let's calculate the moment of inertia \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting the values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Now, let's compute this value step by step. 

I would like your input on the calculations and if you see any potential errors or alternative methods we should consider. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think we should clarify the moment of inertia calculation. The formula for a rectangular cross-section should be \(I = \frac{h^4}{12}\), not \(I = \frac{w h^3}{12}\). 

Using the height \(h = 100 \text{ mm}\):

\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100,000,000}{12} \approx 8,333,333.33 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this corrected value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 8,333,333.33}
\]

This will yield a different result than previously calculated. Make sure to use this moment of inertia for your calculations moving forward. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I need to clarify that the correct formula for the moment of inertia \(I\) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \(w\) is the width and \(h\) is the height. 

Using the given dimensions:
- Width \(w = 50 \text{ mm}\)
- Height \(h = 100 \text{ mm}\)

Calculating \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(F = 1000 \text{ N}\)
2. \(L^3 = (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \text{ mm}^3\)
3. \(E = 210,000 \text{ N/mm}^2\)
4. \(I = 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4\)

Now, substituting these values into the equation:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,628,000,000,000
\]

Now, calculating \(\delta_{max}\):

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.00038 \text{ mm} \approx 0.38 \text{ mm}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.38 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon re-evaluating the calculations based on the correct formula for the moment of inertia and the subsequent substitutions into the deflection formula, I confirm the calculations as follows:

1. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**:
   \[
   I = \frac{w h^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} \approx 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
   \]

2. **Deflection Formula**:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   - \(F = 1000 \text{ N}\)
   - \(L = 1000 \text{ mm}\)
   - \(E = 210,000 \text{ N/mm}^2\)
   - \(I = 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4\)

3. **Calculating Maximum Deflection**:
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
   \]
   - \(L^3 = (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000 \text{ mm}^3\)
   - Denominator: \(3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,628,000,000,000\)

   Now calculating \(\delta_{max}\):
   \[
   \delta_{max} = \frac{1,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.00038 \text{ mm} \approx 0.38 \text{ mm}
   \]

After reviewing the calculations, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **0.38 mm**.

Final Decision: **The maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.38 mm.**
