        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end of a beam that is 1 meter long. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity (E) is given as 210 kN/mm\u00b2.\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{F \\cdot L^3}{3 \\cdot E \\cdot I}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\delta \\) = maximum deflection\n- \\( F \\) = point load (1 kN = 1000 N)\n- \\( L \\) = length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm)\n- \\( E \\) = modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000 N/mm\u00b2)\n- \\( I \\) = moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \\( I = \\frac{w \\cdot h^3}{12} \\)\n\nLet's calculate \\( I \\):\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{50 \\cdot (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\cdot 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \\, mm^4\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting the values into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (1000)^3}{3 \\cdot 210000 \\cdot 416666.67}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step will give us the maximum deflection. Please check the calculations and provide any insights or corrections. What do you think?"
