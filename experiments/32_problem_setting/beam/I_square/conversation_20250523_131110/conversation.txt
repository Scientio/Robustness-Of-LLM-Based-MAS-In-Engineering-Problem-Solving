##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam problem where a vertical point load of 1 kN is applied at the free end. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. The length of the beam is 1 m, and the modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section, calculated as:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

Let's calculate \( I \) first:
- \( w = 50 \) mm,
- \( h = 100 \) mm.

Now, let's compute \( I \):
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = \frac{50,000,000}{12} \approx 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Next, we substitute \( F \), \( L \), \( E \), and \( I \) into the deflection formula to find the maximum deflection. 

Can you please verify the calculations and confirm if we are on the right track?
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, there's a small oversight in your calculation for the moment of inertia \( I \). The correct formula for the moment of inertia of a rectangular cross-section is:

\[
I = \frac{h^4}{12}
\]

So, with \( h = 100 \) mm, we compute \( I \) as follows:

\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100,000,000}{12} \approx 8,333,333.33 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now, substituting this value into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 8,333,333.33}
\]

This will yield the correct maximum deflection. Make sure to use this value for \( I \) in your calculations!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia calculation. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) of a rectangular cross-section is:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

For our beam:
- Width \( w = 50 \) mm,
- Height \( h = 100 \) mm.

Thus, the correct calculation for \( I \) should be:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = \frac{50,000,000}{12} \approx 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Now let's substitute the correct values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Now, let's compute the value:

1. \( 1000 \times 1,000,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,628,000,000,000 \)

Finally, 

\[
\delta_{max} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.38 \text{ mm}
\]

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 0.38 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
After reviewing the calculations and the reasoning behind them, I can confirm that the moment of inertia was calculated correctly using the formula for a rectangular cross-section:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

With:
- Width \( w = 50 \) mm,
- Height \( h = 100 \) mm.

This gives us:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} \approx 4,166,667 \text{ mm}^4
\]

Substituting the values back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F = 1000 \) N,
- \( L = 1000 \) mm,
- \( E = 210,000 \) N/mm²,
- \( I \approx 4,166,667 \) mm⁴.

Calculating it step by step:

1. \( F L^3 = 1000 \times (1000)^3 = 1,000,000,000,000 \) N·mm³.
2. \( 3 E I = 3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,628,000,000,000 \) N·mm².

Finally, we find:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.38 \text{ mm}
\]

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately **0.38 mm**.
