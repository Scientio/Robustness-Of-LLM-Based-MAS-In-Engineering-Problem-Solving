##### LEAD:
Alright team, we have a cantilever beam with a fixed end, subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with a height of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm. We need to calculate the maximum deflection at the free end.

To find the deflection, we can use the formula for the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N)
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm)
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²)
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \)

Let's calculate the moment of inertia \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \, mm^4
\]

Now we can substitute all values into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

I would like your input on this calculation and if you foresee any issues with this approach.
##### ADVISOR:
It looks like you're on the right track, but there's a critical error in the moment of inertia calculation. The moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular section is actually given by \( I = \frac{h^4}{12} \), not \( \frac{w h^3}{12} \). 

So, for your beam with a height \( h = 100 \, mm \):

\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100,000,000}{12} = 8,333,333.33 \, mm^4
\]

Make sure to use this value for \( I \) in your deflection formula. The rest of your calculations should work fine with this correction. Just be cautious not to mix up the formulas!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input, but I believe there is a misunderstanding regarding the moment of inertia. The correct formula for the moment of inertia \( I \) of a rectangular section is indeed:

\[
I = \frac{w h^3}{12}
\]

where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

For our beam, the correct calculation is:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,667 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Calculating this gives us:

\[
\delta_{max} = \frac{1000 \times 1,000,000,000}{3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667}
\]

Let's compute this step by step:

1. \( 1000 \times 1,000,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 \)
2. \( 3 \times 210,000 \times 4,166,667 \approx 2,628,000,000,000 \)
3. Thus, \( \delta_{max} \approx \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{2,628,000,000,000} \approx 0.380 \, mm \)

Therefore, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.380 mm.

Preliminary Decision: Maximum deflection is approximately 0.380 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
After reviewing the calculations and ensuring that the correct moment of inertia was used, I confirm that the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 0.380 mm. 

Final Decision: 0.380 mm.

Upon receiving feedback from the team regarding the moment of inertia, I clarified the correct formula and recalculated the moment of inertia for the beam's rectangular cross-section. I then proceeded to substitute the correct values into the deflection formula, ensuring that the calculations were accurate.
