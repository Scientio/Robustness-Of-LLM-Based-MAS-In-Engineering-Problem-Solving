##### LEAD:
Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam dimensions are 1 m in length, 100 mm in height, and 50 mm in width. The modulus of elasticity is given as 210 kN/mm².

To find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for the deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:

\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( \delta \) is the deflection,
- \( F \) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),
- \( L \) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm² = 210,000 N/mm²),
- \( I \) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, calculated as \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \).

Let's calculate \( I \):
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now substituting the values into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

I would like your input on this calculation and if you have any suggestions or corrections before we finalize our preliminary decision.
##### ADVISOR:
Actually, I think we should consider the moment of inertia differently. For a rectangular cross-section, we should use the formula \( I = \frac{h^4}{12} \) instead of \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \). 

Given the height \( h = 100 \, mm \):

\[
I = \frac{(100)^4}{12} = \frac{100000000}{12} = 8333333.33 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this new value of \( I \) into the deflection formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 8333333.33}
\]

This will give us a different value for the deflection. Let's go ahead and calculate that. It might be worthwhile to double-check this approach to ensure our results are accurate.
##### LEAD:
I appreciate your input, but I must clarify that the moment of inertia \( I \) for a rectangular cross-section is indeed calculated using the formula \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \), where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height. 

Using the correct dimensions:
- Width \( w = 50 \, mm \)
- Height \( h = 100 \, mm \)

The correct calculation for the moment of inertia is:
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Now, substituting this value back into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67} = \frac{1000000000000}{263333333.33} \approx 3.80 \, mm
\]

So, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately 3.80 mm.

Preliminary Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 3.80 mm.
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations and the moment of inertia, I must reiterate that the moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section is indeed calculated as \( I = \frac{w h^3}{12} \). 

Given the values:
- Width \( w = 50 \, mm \)
- Height \( h = 100 \, mm \)

The calculation for the moment of inertia is:
\[
I = \frac{50 \times (100)^3}{12} = \frac{50 \times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \, mm^4
\]

Next, substituting this value into the deflection formula:
\[
\delta = \frac{F L^3}{3 E I}
\]

Where:
- \( F = 1000 \, N \)
- \( L = 1000 \, mm \)
- \( E = 210000 \, N/mm^2 \)

Calculating the deflection:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times (1000)^3}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\delta = \frac{1000 \times 1000000000000}{3 \times 210000 \times 416666.67}
\]
\[
\delta = \frac{1000000000000}{263333333.33} \approx 3.80 \, mm
\]

Therefore, the maximum deflection at the free end of the cantilever beam is approximately **3.80 mm**.

Final Decision: The maximum deflection at the free end is approximately 3.80 mm.
