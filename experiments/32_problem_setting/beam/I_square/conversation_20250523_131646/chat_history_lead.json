        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with dimensions: height \\( h = 100 \\) mm and width \\( w = 50 \\) mm. The length of the beam is 1 m, and the modulus of elasticity \\( E = 210 \\) kN/mm\u00b2.\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection \\( \\delta \\) of a cantilever beam under a point load at its free end:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),\n- \\( E \\) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000 N/mm\u00b2),\n- \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia of the rectangular cross-section, given by:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{w h^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( I \\):\n- \\( w = 50 \\) mm,\n- \\( h = 100 \\) mm.\n\nNow, I need your advice on the calculations to ensure we have the correct approach.

Instead of the standard formula, let's consider the moment of inertia \\( I \\) for the rectangular cross-section as:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{h^4}{12}\n\\]\n\nThis approach will help us get a different perspective on the calculations.
