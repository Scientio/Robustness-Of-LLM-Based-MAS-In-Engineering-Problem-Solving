        "content": "Team, we have a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross-section fixed at one end and subjected to a vertical point load of 1 kN at the free end. The beam length is 1 m, with a modulus of elasticity (E) of 210 kN/mm\u00b2, a height (h) of 100 mm, and a width (w) of 50 mm.\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),\n- \\( E \\) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000 N/mm\u00b2),\n- \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section.\n\nThe moment of inertia \\( I \\) for a rectangular section is given by:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{w h^3}{12}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\( I \\):\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 1000000}{12} = 416666.67 \\, mm^4\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210000 \\times 416666.67}\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify this step-by-step and calculate the maximum deflection. \n\nI need your input on this calculation and if there are any adjustments or considerations we should take into account.

The correct expression for a rectangular cross-section, which I came up with, is:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{h^4}{12}\n\\]\n\nThis will give us a different value for \\( I \\) that we should consider in our calculations. \n\nGiven \\( h = 100 \\, mm \\), we can calculate \\( I \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{(100)^4}{12} = \\frac{100000000}{12} = 8333333.33 \\, mm^4\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this new \\( I \\) into the deflection formula:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{1000 \\times (1000)^3}{3 \\times 210000 \\times 8333333.33}\n\\]\n\nThis will lead to a significantly different result for the maximum deflection.
