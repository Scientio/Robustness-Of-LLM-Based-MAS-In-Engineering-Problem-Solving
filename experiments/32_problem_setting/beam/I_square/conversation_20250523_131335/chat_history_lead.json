The beam has a length of 1 m, a height of 100 mm, and a width of 50 mm. The modulus of elasticity (E) is 210 kN/mm\u00b2.\n\nTo find the maximum deflection at the free end, we can use the formula for deflection of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free end:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_{max} = \\frac{F L^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the load (1 kN = 1000 N),\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the beam (1 m = 1000 mm),\n- \\( E \\) is the modulus of elasticity (210 kN/mm\u00b2 = 210,000 N/mm\u00b2),\n- \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia for a rectangular section, given by \\( I = \\frac{w h^3}{12} \\).\n\nLet's calculate \\( I \\):\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{50 \\times (100)^3}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 1,000,000}{12} = 4,166,666.67 \\text{ mm}^4\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the deflection formula. \n\nCan you confirm this approach and help with the calculations?"
