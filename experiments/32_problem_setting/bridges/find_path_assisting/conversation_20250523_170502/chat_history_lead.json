A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

Identify the connections:\n   - A to B: 3 bridges\n   - B to C: 3 bridges\n   - C to D: 3 bridges\n\n2. Count the degree of each vertex:\n   - Degree of A: 3 (connected to B)\n   - Degree of B: 6 (connected to A and C)\n   - Degree of C: 6 (connected to B and D)\n   - Degree of D: 3 (connected to C)\n\n3. An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. Here, A and D have an odd degree (3), while B and C have an even degree (6).\n\n4. Start the path at one of the odd degree vertices (A or D). Let's start at A.\n\n5. A possible path could be:\n   - A to B (1st bridge)\n   - A to B (2nd bridge)\n   - A to B (3rd bridge)\n   - B to C (1st bridge)\n   - B to C (2nd bridge)\n   - B to C (3rd bridge)\n   - C to D (1st bridge)\n   - C to D (2nd bridge)\n   - C to D (3rd bridge)\n\nThis path crosses each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at A, then cross the bridges in the order listed above."
