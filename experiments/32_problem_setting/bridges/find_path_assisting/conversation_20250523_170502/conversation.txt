##### LEAD:
To solve the problem, we need to find an Eulerian path, which is a trail in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. 

1. Identify the connections:
   - A to B: 3 bridges
   - B to C: 3 bridges
   - C to D: 3 bridges

2. Count the degree of each vertex:
   - Degree of A: 3 (connected to B)
   - Degree of B: 6 (connected to A and C)
   - Degree of C: 6 (connected to B and D)
   - Degree of D: 3 (connected to C)

3. An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. Here, A and D have an odd degree (3), while B and C have an even degree (6).

4. Start the path at one of the odd degree vertices (A or D). Let's start at A.

5. A possible path could be:
   - A to B (1st bridge)
   - A to B (2nd bridge)
   - A to B (3rd bridge)
   - B to C (1st bridge)
   - B to C (2nd bridge)
   - B to C (3rd bridge)
   - C to D (1st bridge)
   - C to D (2nd bridge)
   - C to D (3rd bridge)

This path crosses each bridge exactly once.

Preliminary Decision: Start at A, then cross the bridges in the order listed above.
##### ADVISOR:
Your path effectively covers all the bridges exactly once. Starting at A and following the order:

1. A to B (3 times)
2. B to C (3 times)
3. C to D (3 times)

This ensures that each bridge is crossed exactly once. Good job!
