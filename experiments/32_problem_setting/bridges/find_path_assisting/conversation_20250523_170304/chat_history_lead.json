A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

        "content": "To determine a path that crosses every bridge exactly once, we need to analyze the connections:\n\n- A is connected to B (3 bridges)\n- B is connected to C (3 bridges)\n- C is connected to D (3 bridges)\n\nThe structure can be visualized as a linear path: A -- B -- C -- D, with three bridges between each pair of islands. \n\nTo find an Eulerian path (a path that visits every edge exactly once), we need to check the degree of each vertex (island):\n\n- Degree of A: 3 (connected to B)\n- Degree of B: 6 (3 to A and 3 to C)\n- Degree of C: 6 (3 to B and 3 to D)\n- Degree of D: 3 (connected to C)\n\nAn Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. Here, A and D have an odd degree (3), while B and C have even degrees (6). Thus, we can start at one of the odd-degree vertices (A or D) and end at the other (D or A).\n\nWe can outline the path as follows, starting from A:\n\n1. A to B (1st bridge)\n2. A to B (2nd bridge)\n3. A to B (3rd bridge)\n4. B to C (1st bridge)\n5. B to C (2nd bridge)\n6. B to C (3rd bridge)\n7. C to D (1st bridge)\n8. C to D (2nd bridge)\n9. C to D (3rd bridge)\n\nThis path crosses each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at A, traverse to B (3 times), then to C (3 times), and finally to D (3 times)."
