Here, A and D have an odd degree (3), while B and C have even degrees (6). Thus, we can start at one of the odd-degree vertices (A or D) and end at the other (D or A).\n\nWe can outline the path as follows, starting from A:\n\n1. A to B (1st bridge)\n2. A to B (2nd bridge)\n3. A to B (3rd bridge)\n4. B to C (1st bridge)\n5. B to C (2nd bridge)\n6. B to C (3rd bridge)\n7. C to D (1st bridge)\n8. C to D (2nd bridge)\n9. C to D (3rd bridge)\n\nThis path crosses each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at A, traverse to B (3 times), then to C (3 times), and finally to D (3 times)."
