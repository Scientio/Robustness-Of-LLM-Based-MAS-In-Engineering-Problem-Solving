Determine the degree of each island:\n   - Island A: 3 (connected to B)\n   - Island B: 4 (connected to A and C)\n   - Island C: 4 (connected to B and D)\n   - Island D: 3 (connected to C)\n\n2. Identify odd-degree vertices:\n   - A (3) and D (3) are odd, while B and C are even.\n\nSince we have exactly two vertices of odd degree (A and D), an Eulerian path exists.\n\n3. Construct the path:\nStarting at A, we can follow the bridges as follows:\n- A to B (1st bridge)\n- B to C (2nd bridge)\n- C to D (3rd bridge)\n- D to C (4th bridge)\n- C to B (5th bridge)\n- B to C (6th bridge)\n- C to B (7th bridge)\n- B to A (8th bridge)\n\nHowever, this path does not satisfy crossing each bridge only once. \n\nInstead, a valid path is:\n- A to B (1st bridge)\n- B to C (2nd bridge)\n- C to D (3rd bridge)\n- D to C (4th bridge)\n- C to B (5th bridge)\n- B to A (6th bridge)\n\nThis path crosses each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A."

Start at A.\n2. A to B (1st bridge)\n3. B to C (2nd bridge)\n4. C to D (3rd bridge)\n5. D to C (4th bridge)\n6. C to B (5th bridge)\n7.
