In this case, A and D have an odd degree (3), while B and C have an even degree (6).\n\nSince we have exactly two vertices with an odd degree (A and D), an Eulerian path exists. \n\nNow we need to find the path. Starting from A (one of the odd degree vertices), we can cross the bridges as follows:\n\n1. A to B (1st bridge)\n2. A to B (2nd bridge)\n3. A to B (3rd bridge)\n4. B to C (1st bridge)\n5. B to C (2nd bridge)\n6. B to C (3rd bridge)\n7. C to D (1st bridge)\n8. C to D (2nd bridge)\n9. C to D (3rd bridge)\n\nThe path is: A -> B (3 times) -> C (3 times) -> D (3 times).\n\nPreliminary Decision: A -> B -> B -> B -> C -> C -> C -> D -> D -> D."
