An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.\n\n1. **Identify the connections**:\n   - A to B: 3 bridges (degree 3 for A and B)\n   - B to C: 3 bridges (degree 3 for B and C)\n   - C to D: 3 bridges (degree 3 for C and D)\n\n2. **Calculate degrees**:\n   - A: 3 (odd)\n   - B: 6 (even)\n   - C: 6 (even)\n   - D: 3 (odd)\n\n3. **Vertices with odd degrees**: A and D (2 vertices).\n\nSince there are exactly 2 vertices of odd degree, there exists an Eulerian path. The path must start at one of the odd degree vertices (A or D) and end at the other (D or A).\n\n4. **Constructing the path**:\n   - Start at A, go to B (1st bridge)\n   - Go to C (2nd bridge)\n   - Return to B (3rd bridge)\n   - Go to C (4th bridge)\n   - Return to B (5th bridge)\n   - Go to A (6th bridge)\n   - Go to B (7th bridge)\n   - Go to C (8th bridge)\n   - Go to D (9th bridge)\n   - Return to C (10th bridge)\n   - Go to D (11th bridge)\n   - Return to C (12th bridge)\n   - Go to D (13th bridge)\n\nThis traversal uses all bridges exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at A, go to B, C, back to B, C, back to B, A, B, C, D, C, D."
