An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. \n\nIn this case:\n- Island A has a degree of 3 (connected to B).\n- Island B has a degree of 4 (connected to A and C).\n- Island C has a degree of 4 (connected to B and D).\n- Island D has a degree of 3 (connected to C).\n\nIslands A and D have odd degrees, while B and C have even degrees. Thus, an Eulerian path exists between A and D.\n\nTo find the path that crosses every bridge exactly once:\n1. Start at island A.\n2. Move to island B (cross one bridge).\n3.
