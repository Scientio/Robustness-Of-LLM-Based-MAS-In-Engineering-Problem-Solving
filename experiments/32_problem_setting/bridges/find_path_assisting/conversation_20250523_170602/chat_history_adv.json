An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. \n\nIn this case:\n- Island A has a degree of 3 (connected to B).\n- Island B has a degree of 4 (connected to A and C).\n- Island C has a degree of 4 (connected to B and D).\n- Island D has a degree of 3 (connected to C).\n\nIslands A and D have odd degrees, while B and C have even degrees. Thus, an Eulerian path exists between A and D.\n\nTo find the path that crosses every bridge exactly once:\n1. Start at island A.\n2. Move to island B (cross one bridge).\n3. Move to island C (cross another bridge).\n4. Move to island D (cross the third bridge).\n5. Move back to island C (cross one bridge).\n6. Move back to island B (cross another bridge).\n7. Move back to island A (cross the last bridge).\n8. Move to island B (cross one bridge).\n9. Move to island C (cross another bridge).\n10. Move to island D (cross the last bridge).\n\nThis path crosses each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D."
