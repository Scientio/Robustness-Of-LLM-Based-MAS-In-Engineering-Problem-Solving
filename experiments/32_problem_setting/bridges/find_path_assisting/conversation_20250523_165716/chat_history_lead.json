A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

        "content": "To solve this problem, we can represent the islands and bridges as a graph. Each island is a vertex, and each set of three bridges between islands represents edges. \n\nThe connections are:\n- A to B (3 bridges)\n- B to C (3 bridges)\n- C to D (3 bridges)\n\nTo cross every bridge exactly once, we need to find an Eulerian path. An Eulerian path exists in a graph if it has exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. Here, each island has an even degree (6 for A, B, C, and D), so we can find an Eulerian circuit.\n\nWe can start at any vertex and follow these steps:\n\n1. Start at A.\n2. Cross one bridge from A to B.\n3. Cross the second bridge from B to A.\n4. Cross the third bridge from A to B.\n5. Cross one bridge from B to C.\n6. Cross the second bridge from C to B.\n7. Cross the third bridge from B to C.\n8. Cross one bridge from C to D.\n9. Cross the second bridge from D to C.\n10.
