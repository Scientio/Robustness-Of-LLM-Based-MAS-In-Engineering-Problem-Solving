A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

Identify the islands as vertices: A, B, C, D.\n2. Count the degree of each vertex:\n   - A: degree 3 (connected to B)\n   - B: degree 4 (connected to A and C)\n   - C: degree 4 (connected to B and D)\n   - D: degree 1 (connected to C)\n\n3. For an Eulerian path to exist, there must be exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. Here, A and D have odd degrees. \n\n4. Therefore, the Eulerian path can start at one of the odd degree vertices (A or D) and end at the other (D or A).\n\n5. A possible path can be:\n   - Start at A, go to B (first bridge)\n   - Go to C (second bridge)\n   - Go to B (third bridge)\n   - Go to C (fourth bridge)\n   - Go to D (fifth bridge)\n   - Go to C (sixth bridge)\n   - Go to B (seventh bridge)\n   - Go to A (eighth bridge)\n\nThis path crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The path is A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A."
