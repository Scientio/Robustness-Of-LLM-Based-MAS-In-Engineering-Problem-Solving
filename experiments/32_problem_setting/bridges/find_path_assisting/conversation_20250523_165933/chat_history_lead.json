A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and their degrees**:\n   - A is connected to B (3 bridges)\n   - B is connected to A (3 bridges) and C (3 bridges)\n   - C is connected to B (3 bridges) and D (3 bridges)\n   - D is connected to C (3 bridges)\n\n   Degrees:\n   - A: 3 (odd)\n   - B: 6 (even)\n   - C: 6 (even)\n   - D: 3 (odd)\n\n   There are 2 vertices (A and D) with odd degrees.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Since there are exactly 2 vertices of odd degree, an Eulerian path exists. \n\n3. **Finding the path**: Start at one of the odd degree vertices (A or D). Let's start at A.\n\n**Step-by-step path**:\n1. A to B (1)\n2. B to C (1)\n3. C to D (1)\n4. D to C (2)\n5. C to B (2)\n6. B to A (2)\n7. A to B (2)\n8. B to C (2)\n9. C to D (2)\n\nThis path crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The Eulerian path is A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D."
