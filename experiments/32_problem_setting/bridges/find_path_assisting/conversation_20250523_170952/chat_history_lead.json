A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

        "content": "This problem can be modeled as an Eulerian path problem in graph theory. An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree. \n\nIn this case:\n- Island A has a degree of 3 (connected to B).\n- Island B has a degree of 4 (connected to A and C).\n- Island C has a degree of 4 (connected to B and D).\n- Island D has a degree of 3 (connected to C).\n\nIslands A and D have odd degrees, while B and C have even degrees. Therefore, there are exactly two vertices with odd degrees, meaning an Eulerian path exists.\n\nTo find the path that crosses every bridge exactly once:\n1. Start at Island A.\n2. Cross to Island B (first bridge).\n3. Cross to Island C (second bridge).\n4. Cross to Island D (third bridge).\n5. Cross back to Island C (fourth bridge).\n6. Cross back to Island B (fifth bridge).\n7. Cross back to Island C (sixth bridge).\n8. Finally, cross back to Island A (seventh bridge).\n\nThis sequence allows us to cross each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 A."
