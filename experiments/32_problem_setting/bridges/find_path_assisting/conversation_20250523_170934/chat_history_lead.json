An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. \n\nLet's analyze the connections:\n- A is connected to B (3 bridges)\n- B is connected to C (3 bridges)\n- C is connected to D (3 bridges)\n\nDegree of each island:\n- A: 3 (odd)\n- B: 4 (even)\n- C: 4 (even)\n- D: 3 (odd)\n\nSince there are two vertices (A and D) of odd degree, an Eulerian path is possible. \n\nA possible path can be:\n1.
