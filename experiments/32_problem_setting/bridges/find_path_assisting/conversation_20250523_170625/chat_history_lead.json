A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

A to B (1)\n2. B to C (1)\n3. C to D (1)\n4. D to C (1)\n5. C to B (1)\n6. B to A (1)\n7. A to B (1)\n8. B to C (1)\n9. C to D (1)\n10. D to C (1)\n11. C to B (1)\n\nThis sequence ensures that each bridge is crossed once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: An Eulerian path exists starting from A to D, using the bridges in the sequence: A-B-C-D-C-B-A-B-C-D-C-B."
