        "content": "To find a path that crosses every bridge exactly once, we need to determine if an Eulerian path exists in the graph formed by the islands and bridges. \n\n1. **Identify the connections**:\n   - A is connected to B (3 bridges)\n   - B is connected to C (3 bridges)\n   - C is connected to D (3 bridges)\n\n2. **Degree of each vertex**:\n   - A: degree 3 (connected to B)\n   - B: degree 6 (connected to A and C)\n   - C: degree 6 (connected to B and D)\n   - D: degree 3 (connected to C)\n\n3. **Check for Eulerian path conditions**:\n   An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. Here, A and D have odd degrees (3), while B and C have even degrees (6).\n\n4. **Starting and ending points**:\n   Since there are two vertices of odd degree (A and D), the Eulerian path must start at one of these and end at the other.\n\n5. **Construct the path**:\n   Starting at A and ending at D, we can create a path as follows:\n   - A \u2192 B (1st bridge)\n   - A \u2192 B (2nd bridge)\n   - A \u2192 B (3rd bridge)\n   - B \u2192 C (1st bridge)\n   - B \u2192 C (2nd bridge)\n   - B \u2192 C (3rd bridge)\n   - C \u2192 D (1st bridge)\n   - C \u2192 D (2nd bridge)\n   - C \u2192 D (3rd bridge)\n\n6. **Final path**:\n   The path can be summarized as:\n   - A \u2192 B (3 times)\n   - B \u2192 C (3 times)\n   - C \u2192 D (3 times)\n\nPreliminary Decision: The path is A \u2192 B (3 times) \u2192 C (3 times) \u2192 D (3 times)."
