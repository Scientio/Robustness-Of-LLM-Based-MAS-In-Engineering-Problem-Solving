An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.\n\n1. **Identify the degree of each island (vertex)**:\n   - Island A: 3 bridges (connected to B) \u2192 degree 3 (odd)\n   - Island B: 3 bridges (connected to A and C) \u2192 degree 4 (even)\n   - Island C: 3 bridges (connected to B and D) \u2192 degree 4 (even)\n   - Island D: 3 bridges (connected to C) \u2192 degree 3 (odd)\n\n2. **Count the odd degree vertices**:\n   - A (odd) and D (odd) are the only islands with odd degrees.\n\nSince there are exactly 2 vertices with odd degrees (A and D), an Eulerian path exists.\n\n3. **Finding the Eulerian path**:\n   - Start at one of the odd degree vertices (A).\n   - Traverse the bridges as follows:\n     - A to B (1st bridge)\n     - B to C (2nd bridge)\n     - C to D (3rd bridge)\n     - D to C (4th bridge)\n     - C to B (5th bridge)\n     - B to A (6th bridge)\n     - A to B (7th bridge)\n     - B to C (8th bridge)\n     - C to D (9th bridge)\n\nThis path crosses each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The Eulerian path is A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D."
