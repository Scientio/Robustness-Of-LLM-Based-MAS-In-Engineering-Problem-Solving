##### LEAD:
To solve this problem, we need to identify if there is an Eulerian path in the graph formed by the islands and bridges. An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.

1. **Identify the degree of each island (vertex)**:
   - Island A: 3 bridges (connected to B) → degree 3 (odd)
   - Island B: 3 bridges (connected to A and C) → degree 4 (even)
   - Island C: 3 bridges (connected to B and D) → degree 4 (even)
   - Island D: 3 bridges (connected to C) → degree 3 (odd)

2. **Count the odd degree vertices**:
   - A (odd) and D (odd) are the only islands with odd degrees.

Since there are exactly 2 vertices with odd degrees (A and D), an Eulerian path exists.

3. **Finding the Eulerian path**:
   - Start at one of the odd degree vertices (A).
   - Traverse the bridges as follows:
     - A to B (1st bridge)
     - B to C (2nd bridge)
     - C to D (3rd bridge)
     - D to C (4th bridge)
     - C to B (5th bridge)
     - B to A (6th bridge)
     - A to B (7th bridge)
     - B to C (8th bridge)
     - C to D (9th bridge)

This path crosses each bridge exactly once.

Preliminary Decision: The Eulerian path is A → B → C → D → C → B → A → B → C → D.
##### ADVISOR:
Your analysis is correct. An Eulerian path exists in this graph since there are exactly 2 vertices (A and D) with odd degrees. The path you provided, A → B → C → D → C → B → A → B → C → D, effectively crosses each bridge exactly once. Well done!
