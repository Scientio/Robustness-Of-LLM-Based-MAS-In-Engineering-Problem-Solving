A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

        "content": "To solve the problem of crossing every bridge exactly once, we can represent the islands and bridges as a graph. Each island is a vertex, and each bridge is an edge connecting the vertices.\n\nThe connections are as follows:\n- A to B: 3 bridges\n- B to C: 3 bridges\n- C to D: 3 bridges\n\nThis forms a linear path: A -- B -- C -- D.\n\nTo find an Eulerian path (a path that visits every edge exactly once), we need to check the degrees of each vertex:\n- A: Degree 3 (connected to B)\n- B: Degree 6 (connected to A and C)\n- C: Degree 6 (connected to B and D)\n- D: Degree 3 (connected to C)\n\nAn Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree. Here, vertices A and D have an odd degree. Therefore, an Eulerian path exists.\n\nTo construct the path, we can start at one of the odd-degree vertices (A or D). Starting at A, we can outline the path as follows:\n\n1. A to B (1st bridge)\n2. A to B (2nd bridge)\n3. A to B (3rd bridge)\n4. B to C (1st bridge)\n5. B to C (2nd bridge)\n6. B to C (3rd bridge)\n7. C to D (1st bridge)\n8. C to D (2nd bridge)\n9. C to D (3rd bridge)\n\nThis path crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at A, the path is A-B (3 times), B-C (3 times), C-D (3 times)."
