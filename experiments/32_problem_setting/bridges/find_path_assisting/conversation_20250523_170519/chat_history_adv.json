        "content": "This problem can be modeled as an Eulerian path problem in graph theory. An Eulerian path exists if there are at most two vertices with an odd degree. \n\nIn this case:\n- Island A connects to B (3 bridges)\n- Island B connects to A and C (3 bridges to A and 3 bridges to C)\n- Island C connects to B and D (3 bridges to B and 3 bridges to D)\n- Island D connects to C (3 bridges)\n\nCalculating the degrees:\n- Degree of A: 3 (odd)\n- Degree of B: 6 (even)\n- Degree of C: 6 (even)\n- Degree of D: 3 (odd)\n\nThere are two islands (A and D) with odd degrees, which means an Eulerian path exists.\n\nA possible path that crosses every bridge exactly once is:\n1. Start at A\n2. Cross to B\n3. Cross to C\n4. Cross to D\n5. Cross back to C\n6. Cross to B\n7. Cross back to A\n8. Cross to B\n9. Cross to C\n10. Cross to D\n\nThis path ensures all bridges are crossed exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The path is A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D."
