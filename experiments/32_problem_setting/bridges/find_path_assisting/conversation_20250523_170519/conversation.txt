##### LEAD:
This problem can be modeled as an Eulerian path problem in graph theory. An Eulerian path exists if there are at most two vertices with an odd degree. 

In this case:
- Island A connects to B (3 bridges)
- Island B connects to A and C (3 bridges to A and 3 bridges to C)
- Island C connects to B and D (3 bridges to B and 3 bridges to D)
- Island D connects to C (3 bridges)

Calculating the degrees:
- Degree of A: 3 (odd)
- Degree of B: 6 (even)
- Degree of C: 6 (even)
- Degree of D: 3 (odd)

There are two islands (A and D) with odd degrees, which means an Eulerian path exists.

A possible path that crosses every bridge exactly once is:
1. Start at A
2. Cross to B
3. Cross to C
4. Cross to D
5. Cross back to C
6. Cross to B
7. Cross back to A
8. Cross to B
9. Cross to C
10. Cross to D

This path ensures all bridges are crossed exactly once.

Preliminary Decision: The path is A → B → C → D → C → B → A → B → C → D.
##### ADVISOR:
Your analysis of the Eulerian path is correct, and the proposed path does cross all bridges exactly once. 

To summarize:
- The graph has two vertices (A and D) with odd degrees, allowing for an Eulerian path.
- The path A → B → C → D → C → B → A → B → C → D successfully traverses all bridges.

Final Confirmation: The path is valid.
