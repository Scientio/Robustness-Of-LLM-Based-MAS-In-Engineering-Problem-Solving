In this case, A and D have an odd degree, while B and C have even degrees. \n\nNow, we can construct the path:\n1. Start at A.\n2. Cross to B (1st bridge).\n3. Cross back to A (2nd bridge).\n4. Cross to B (3rd bridge).\n5. Cross to C (1st bridge).\n6. Cross to B (4th bridge).\n7. Cross to C (2nd bridge).\n8. Cross to D (1st bridge).\n9. Cross to C (3rd bridge).\n10. Cross to D (2nd bridge).\n11. Cross to C (4th bridge).\n12. Cross to B (5th bridge).\n13. Cross to C (5th bridge).\n14. Cross to B (6th bridge).\n\nThis path crosses every bridge exactly once. \n\nPreliminary Decision: The path is A \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 D."
