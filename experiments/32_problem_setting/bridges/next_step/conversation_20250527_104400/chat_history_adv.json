        "content": "Team, we have an interesting problem involving four islands: A, B, C, and D. The connections between them are as follows:\n\n- A is connected to B (3 bridges)\n- B is connected to C (3 bridges)\n- C is connected to D (3 bridges)\n\nOur goal is to find a path that allows us to cross every bridge exactly once, starting from island A. This is a classic Eulerian path problem, where we need to ensure that we can traverse each edge (bridge) exactly once.\n\nFor our first step, I suggest we start by moving from island A to island B. This will allow us to begin our traversal while keeping our options open for the remaining bridges. \n\nWhat do you think about this first step? Any suggestions or concerns?"

Move to island C, where we can cross one of the three bridges to C.\n\nSince we want to avoid crossing any bridge more than once, the logical next step is to move from island B to island C.\n\nShall we proceed with this move?"
