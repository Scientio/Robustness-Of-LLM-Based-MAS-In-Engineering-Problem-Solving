A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). You start at island A and iteratively agree on the next step with your team. Explain this problem to your team, suggest a first step and ask for their advice. "

This is known as an Eulerian path problem in graph theory. \n\nThe connections between the islands are as follows:\n- A is connected to B by 3 bridges.\n- B is connected to C by 3 bridges.\n- C is connected to D by 3 bridges.\n\nTo start, I suggest our first step be to move from island A to island B. This will allow us to begin crossing the bridges while keeping track of our path. \n\nWhat does everyone think about this initial step?"

After that, we can move from C to D. This way, we will be crossing each bridge only once. \n\nSo, the proposed path so far is:\n1. A to B\n2. B to C\n3. C to D\n\nShall we proceed with this plan?"
