This is a classic Eulerian path problem in graph theory.\n\nThe connections are as follows:\n- A is connected to B (3 bridges)\n- B is connected to C (3 bridges)\n- C is connected to D (3 bridges)\n\nSince we start at island A, a good first step would be to cross one of the bridges from A to B. \n\nWhat do you all think about this first step? Should we proceed to cross a bridge from A to B?"
