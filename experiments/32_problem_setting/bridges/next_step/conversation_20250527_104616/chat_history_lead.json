A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). You start at island A and iteratively agree on the next step with your team. Explain this problem to your team, suggest a first step and ask for their advice. "

We need to find a way to traverse all the bridges connecting the islands A, B, C, and D exactly once, starting from island A. \n\nThe connections are as follows:\n- A is connected to B (3 bridges)\n- B is connected to C (3 bridges)\n- C is connected to D (3 bridges)\n\nSince we start at island A, a logical first step is to cross one of the bridges from A to B. \n\nWhat do you all think about this first step? Shall we proceed to cross a bridge from A to B?"
