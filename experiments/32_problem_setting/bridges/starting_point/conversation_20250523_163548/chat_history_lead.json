D is connected to B and C by each two bridges. You cannot directly move from B to C or vice versa!You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges, and each bridge can only be crossed once. Determine a starting point from which a path exists that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

All vertices with even degree, or\n2. Exactly two vertices with odd degree.\n\nIn this case, vertices B and C have odd degrees. Therefore, we can start at one of these vertices (B or C) and end at the other.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at B or C."

Since A has an even degree (2), starting at A would not allow us to cross every bridge exactly once.\n\nTo successfully traverse every bridge exactly once, we must start at one of the vertices with an odd degree, which are B and C. \n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at B or C."
