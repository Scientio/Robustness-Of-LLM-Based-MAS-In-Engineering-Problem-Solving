        "content": "Your team is given the following problem: A town consists of four islands A, B, C and D. A is connected to B and C by each one bridge. D is connected to B and C by each two bridges. You cannot directly move from B to C or vice versa!You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges, and each bridge can only be crossed once. Determine a starting point from which a path exists that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

The islands A, B, C, and D are the vertices, and the bridges are the edges. \n\n- A is connected to B (1 bridge) and C (1 bridge)\n- D is connected to B (2 bridges) and C (2 bridges)\n- B and C are not directly connected.\n\nThe degrees of the vertices are:\n- A: 2 (connected to B and C)\n- B: 3 (1 to A, 2 to D)\n- C: 3 (1 to A, 2 to D)\n- D: 4 (2 to B, 2 to C)\n\nFor an Eulerian path (a path that crosses every edge exactly once), we need to have either:\n1. All vertices with even degrees (Eulerian circuit), or \n2. Exactly two vertices with odd degrees (Eulerian path).\n\nIn this case, vertices B and C have odd degrees (3), while A has even degree (2) and D has even degree (4). Therefore, we have exactly two vertices with odd degrees (B and C).\n\nThis means we can start from either B or C to find a path that crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either B or C."

An Eulerian path must start and end at vertices of odd degree. \n\nSince B and C are the only vertices with odd degrees, we must start from either B or C to ensure we can traverse all bridges exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either B or C."
