D is connected to B and C by each two bridges. You cannot directly move from B to C or vice versa!You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges, and each bridge can only be crossed once. Determine a starting point from which a path exists that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

Here, both B and C have an odd degree (3), while A has an even degree (2) and D has an even degree (4).\n\nThus, we can start at either B or C to find a path that crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at either Island B or Island C."

Plus, it\u2019s the only island that connects to two others directly, which simplifies our route planning. Starting at A allows us to maximize our options right from the beginning. Let's go with A!"

Island A has an even degree (2), meaning it cannot serve as a starting point for such a path, as it would not allow crossing every bridge exactly once.\n\nSince B and C both have an odd degree (3), they are the only valid starting points for an Eulerian path. Starting at A would prevent us from crossing all bridges exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at either Island B or Island C."
