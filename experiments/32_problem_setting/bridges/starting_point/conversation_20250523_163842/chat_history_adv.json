Here, both B and C have an odd degree (3), while A has an even degree (2) and D has an even degree (4).\n\nThus, we can start at either B or C to find a path that crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at either Island B or Island C."

Plus, it\u2019s the only island that connects to two others directly, which simplifies our route planning. Starting at A allows us to maximize our options right from the beginning. Let's go with A!"
