All vertices with even degrees, or\n2. Exactly two vertices with odd degrees.\n\nIn this case:\n- A has an even degree (2).\n- B has an odd degree (3).\n- C has an odd degree (3).\n- D has an even degree (4).\n\nSince there are exactly two vertices (B and C) with odd degrees, an Eulerian path exists. \n\nTo find a starting point, we should start from one of the vertices with an odd degree. Therefore, we can start from either B or C.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either island B or island C."
