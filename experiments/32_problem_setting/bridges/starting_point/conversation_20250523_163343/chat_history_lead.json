D is connected to B and C by each two bridges.

An Eulerian path exists if exactly 0 or 2 vertices have an odd degree. \n\nCalculating the degree of each island:\n- A: degree 2 (connected to B and C)\n- B: degree 3 (connected to A and D)\n- C: degree 3 (connected to A and D)\n- D: degree 4 (connected to B and C)\n\nHere, vertices B and C have an odd degree (3), while A and D have even degrees (2 and 4). Since there are exactly two vertices with odd degrees, an Eulerian path exists, and it must start or end at one of those odd-degree vertices.\n\nThus, the starting point can be either B or C.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from B or C."

Since B and C are the only vertices with odd degrees, the path must start or end at one of these vertices.\n\n3. **Implications of Starting at A**: \n   - If you start at A, you can only go to B or C. After visiting either B or C, you would run into the issue of not being able to cross all bridges without retracing steps, as A would not allow you to return to it without retracing.\n\nThus, starting from A would not allow you to complete the path crossing each bridge exactly once, which is the fundamental requirement of the problem.\n\nFinal Decision: Start from B or C."
