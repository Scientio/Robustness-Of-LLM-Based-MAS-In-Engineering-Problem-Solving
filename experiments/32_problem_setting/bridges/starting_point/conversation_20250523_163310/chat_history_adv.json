Island A connects to B and C (2 edges).\n2. Island B connects to A and D (2 edges) but not to C.\n3. Island C connects to A and D (2 edges) but not to B.\n4. Island D connects to B and C (2 edges).\n\nThe degree of each island (number of edges connected to it) is:\n- A: 2\n- B: 4 (2 to A, 2 to D)\n- C: 4 (2 to A, 2 to D)\n- D: 4 (2 to B, 2 to C)\n\nFor an Eulerian path (a path that crosses every edge exactly once) to exist, at most two vertices can have an odd degree. In this case, all islands have an even degree, which means an Eulerian circuit exists.\n\nTo find a starting point, we can start from any island since we can return to the starting point after crossing all bridges.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from any island (A, B, C, or D)."
