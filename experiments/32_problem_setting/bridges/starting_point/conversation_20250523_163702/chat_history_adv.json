Exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree (in this case, all vertices have even degrees).\n\nSince all vertices have even degrees (2 for A, 4 for B, 4 for C, and 4 for D), it implies that an Eulerian circuit exists. \n\nStarting from any vertex will allow you to traverse all bridges exactly once and return to the starting point. \n\nTherefore, a valid starting point could be any of the islands A, B, C, or D.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from any island (A, B, C, or D)."

This choice indeed minimizes unnecessary backtracking and could streamline the process of crossing each bridge exactly once.\n\nGiven that all vertices have even degrees, the Eulerian circuit can be started from any point, but starting from A may provide a more intuitive and efficient path.\n\nFinal Decision: Start from A."
