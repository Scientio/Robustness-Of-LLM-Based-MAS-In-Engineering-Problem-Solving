D is connected to B and C by each two bridges. You cannot directly move from B to C or vice versa!You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges, and each bridge can only be crossed once.

The islands A, B, C, and D are the vertices, and the bridges are the edges. \n\n- A is connected to B (1 bridge) and C (1 bridge).\n- B is connected to D (2 bridges).\n- C is connected to D (2 bridges).\n\nThe connections can be summarized as follows:\n- A-B (1 bridge)\n- A-C (1 bridge)\n- B-D (2 bridges)\n- C-D (2 bridges)\n\nTo determine if an Eulerian path exists (which allows us to cross each bridge exactly once), we need to check the degree of each vertex:\n- Degree of A = 2 (connected to B and C)\n- Degree of B = 3 (connected to A and D)\n- Degree of C = 3 (connected to A and D)\n- Degree of D = 4 (connected to B and C)\n\nAn Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree. Here, both B and C have an odd degree (3), and A has an even degree (2), while D has an even degree (4).\n\nThus, we can start from either B or C to find a path that crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either B or C."
