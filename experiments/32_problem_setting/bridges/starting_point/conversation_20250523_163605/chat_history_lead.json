D is connected to B and C by each two bridges. You cannot directly move from B to C or vice versa!You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges, and each bridge can only be crossed once.

Here, A has an even degree, D has an even degree, and both B and C have odd degrees.\n\nThus, we can start at either B or C, as both have an odd degree.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at either B or C."
