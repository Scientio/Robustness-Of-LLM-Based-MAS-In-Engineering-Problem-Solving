D is connected to B and C by each two bridges. You cannot directly move from B to C or vice versa!You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges, and each bridge can only be crossed once. Determine a starting point from which a path exists that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

In this case, islands B and C have odd degrees (3), while A has an even degree (2) and D has an even degree (4). \n\nSince there are two vertices with an odd degree (B and C), an Eulerian path exists, and it must start or end at one of these vertices.\n\nThus, we can start our path from either B or C.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either island B or island C."

An Eulerian path requires starting at a vertex with an odd degree if there are vertices with odd degrees present. In this scenario, island A has an even degree (2), while islands B and C have odd degrees (3). \n\nStarting from A would not allow us to traverse all bridges exactly once, as we would eventually be forced to return to A without being able to complete the path.\n\nThus, the correct starting points remain either B or C, as they both have odd degrees.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either island B or island C."
