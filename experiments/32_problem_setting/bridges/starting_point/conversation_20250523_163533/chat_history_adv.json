In this case, islands B and C have odd degrees (3), while A has an even degree (2) and D has an even degree (4). \n\nSince there are two vertices with an odd degree (B and C), an Eulerian path exists, and it must start or end at one of these vertices.\n\nThus, we can start our path from either B or C.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either island B or island C."
