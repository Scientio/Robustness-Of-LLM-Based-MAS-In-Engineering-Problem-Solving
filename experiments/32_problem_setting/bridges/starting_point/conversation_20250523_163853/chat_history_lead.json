D is connected to B and C by each two bridges. You cannot directly move from B to C or vice versa!You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges, and each bridge can only be crossed once. Determine a starting point from which a path exists that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

In this case, both B and C have an odd degree (3), while A and D have even degrees (2). \n\nSince there are exactly two vertices of odd degree, an Eulerian path exists starting from one of the odd degree vertices.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either Island B or Island C."

Since it has a degree of 2, it can serve as a stable starting point, ensuring that we can traverse the path without getting stuck. While B and C have odd degrees, starting from A will help in maintaining control over the traversal. So let\u2019s focus on starting from Island A for a smoother journey!"

In an Eulerian path, starting from a vertex with an even degree will not allow for all edges to be crossed since you would end up with unvisited bridges. \n\nSince B and C are the only islands with odd degrees, the correct starting points for an Eulerian path are indeed B or C. \n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either Island B or Island C."
