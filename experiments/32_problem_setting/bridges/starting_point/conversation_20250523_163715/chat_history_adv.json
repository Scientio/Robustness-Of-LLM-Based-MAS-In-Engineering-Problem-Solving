In this case:\n\n- Islands B and C have odd degrees (3).\n- Islands A and D have even degrees (2 and 4).\n\nSince there are exactly 2 vertices (B and C) of odd degree, we can start from either B or C to find an Eulerian path that crosses each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either Island B or Island C."
