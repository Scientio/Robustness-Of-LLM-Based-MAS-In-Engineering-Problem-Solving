D is connected to B and C by each two bridges. You cannot directly move from B to C or vice versa!You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges, and each bridge can only be crossed once. Determine a starting point from which a path exists that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

In this case:\n\n- Islands B and C have odd degrees (3).\n- Islands A and D have even degrees (2 and 4).\n\nSince there are exactly 2 vertices (B and C) of odd degree, we can start from either B or C to find an Eulerian path that crosses each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either Island B or Island C."

However, since we have two islands (B and C) with odd degrees, an Eulerian path must start at one of those islands to ensure all bridges can be crossed exactly once.\n\nStarting from Island A would not allow for crossing all bridges exactly once, as it would lead to a dead end after using both bridges to B and C. Therefore, the correct approach remains to start from either Island B or Island C.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start from either Island B or Island C."
