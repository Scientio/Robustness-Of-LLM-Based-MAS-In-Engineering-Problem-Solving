D is connected to B and C by each two bridges. You cannot directly move from B to C or vice versa!You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges, and each bridge can only be crossed once. Determine a starting point from which a path exists that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph that visits every edge exactly once.\n\nThe connections are:\n- A to B (1 bridge)\n- A to C (1 bridge)\n- B to D (2 bridges)\n- C to D (2 bridges)\n\nCounting the degrees of each island:\n- Degree of A: 2 (connected to B and C)\n- Degree of B: 3 (connected to A and D)\n- Degree of C: 3 (connected to A and D)\n- Degree of D: 4 (connected to B and C)\n\nFor an Eulerian path to exist, there can be either:\n1. Exactly two vertices with an odd degree, or\n2. All vertices have even degrees.\n\nIn this case, vertices B and C have odd degrees (3), while A has an even degree (2) and D has an even degree (4). Since there are two vertices with odd degrees, an Eulerian path exists.\n\nWe can start the path at one of the vertices with an odd degree, which are B or C. \n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at island B."
