In this case, A and D are the odd degree vertices.\n\n5. **Plan the path:**\n   Starting from A, we can traverse the bridges as follows:\n   - A \u2192 B (1st bridge)\n   - A \u2192 B (2nd bridge)\n   - A \u2192 B (3rd bridge)\n   - B \u2192 C (1st bridge)\n   - B \u2192 C (2nd bridge)\n   - B \u2192 C (3rd bridge)\n   - C \u2192 D (1st bridge)\n   - C \u2192 D (2nd bridge)\n   - C \u2192 D (3rd bridge)\n\nThis path crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\n**Preliminary Decision: A \u2192 B (3 times) \u2192 C (3 times) \u2192 D (3 times)**."
