An Eulerian path exists in a graph if at most two vertices have an odd degree.\n\n1. **Analyze the connections**:\n   - A connects to B: 3 bridges (A-B)\n   - B connects to C: 3 bridges (B-C)\n   - C connects to D: 3 bridges (C-D)\n\n2. **Degree of each island**:\n   - Degree of A: 3 (connected to B)\n   - Degree of B: 6 (connected to A and C)\n   - Degree of C: 6 (connected to B and D)\n   - Degree of D: 3 (connected to C)\n\n3. **Odd degree vertices**: A and D have an odd degree (3), while B and C have even degrees (6).
