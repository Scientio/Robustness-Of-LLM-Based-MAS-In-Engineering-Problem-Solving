This is a classic Eulerian path problem in graph theory.\n\n1. **Identify the Connections:**\n   - A is connected to B (3 bridges)\n   - B is connected to C (3 bridges)\n   - C is connected to D (3 bridges)\n\n2. **Count the Bridges:**\n   - Total bridges: 3 (A-B) + 3 (B-C) + 3 (C-D) = 9 bridges.\n\n3. **Check for Eulerian Path Conditions:**\n   - An Eulerian path exists if there are either 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. Here, each vertex has an even degree:\n     - A: 3 (odd)\n     - B: 6 (even)\n     - C: 6 (even)\n     - D: 3 (odd)\n   - There are two vertices (A and D) with an odd degree.\n\n4. **Construct the Path:**\n   - Start at an odd vertex (A or D). We will start at A.\n   - One possible path is:\n     1. A to B (1st bridge)\n     2. A to B (2nd bridge)\n     3. A to B (3rd bridge)\n     4. B to C (1st bridge)\n     5. B to C (2nd bridge)\n     6. B to C (3rd bridge)\n     7. C to D (1st bridge)\n     8. C to D (2nd bridge)\n     9. C to D (3rd bridge)\n\nThis path crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at A and follow the path A-B, A-B, A-B, B-C, B-C, B-C, C-D, C-D, C-D."

Let's focus on that path for clarity:\n\n1. Start at A.\n2. Move to B.\n3. Then go to C.\n4. Return to B.\n5. Go back to C.\n\nRepeat this sequence until all bridges are crossed.

In fact, it retraces steps and does not fulfill the requirement of an Eulerian path. \n\nThe correct approach is to ensure that each bridge is crossed exactly once without retracing any steps unnecessarily. \n\nThe optimal path I previously provided does meet the requirement by crossing each bridge exactly once without repetition:\n\n1. A to B (1st bridge)\n2. A to B (2nd bridge)\n3. A to B (3rd bridge)\n4. B to C (1st bridge)\n5. B to C (2nd bridge)\n6. B to C (3rd bridge)\n7. C to D (1st bridge)\n8. C to D (2nd bridge)\n9.

Your proposed path of A->B->C->B->C... does indeed suggest a sequence that allows for retracing, which would not fulfill the criteria of crossing each bridge only once.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n1. **Starting Point:** Begin at A.\n2. **First Move:** Move to B.\n3. **Next Move:** Move to C.\n4. **Return Move:** Move back to B.\n5. **Next Move:** Move to C again.\n\nHowever, this sequence would lead to crossing some bridges multiple times, which contradicts the requirement of crossing each bridge exactly once.\n\nThe correct Eulerian path must ensure that every bridge is crossed once without retracing. \n\nThe proper path I outlined earlier does indeed fulfill the requirement:\n1. A to B (3 times)\n2. B to C (3 times)\n3. C to D (3 times)\n\nThis path ensures that every bridge is crossed exactly once without retracing any steps unnecessarily.\n\nFinal Decision: The correct path is A-B, A-B, A-B, B-C, B-C, B-C, C-D, C-D, C-D."
