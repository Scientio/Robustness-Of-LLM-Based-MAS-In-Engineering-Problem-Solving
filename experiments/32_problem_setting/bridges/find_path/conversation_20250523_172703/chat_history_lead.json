A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

Here, vertices A and D have an odd degree (3), while B and C have even degrees (6). Thus, an Eulerian path exists and should start at one of the odd degree vertices (A or D) and end at the other (D or A).\n\nA valid path could be:\n1. Start at A\n2. Cross to B (1)\n3. Cross to C (2)\n4. Cross to B (3)\n5. Cross to C (4)\n6. Cross to D (5)\n7. Cross to C (6)\n8. Cross to B (7)\n9. Cross to C (8)\n10. Cross to D (9)\n11. Cross to C (10)\n12. Cross to B (11)\n13. Cross to A (12)\n14. Cross to B (13)\n15. Cross to C (14)\n16. Cross to D (15)\n\nThis path crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The path is A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D."
