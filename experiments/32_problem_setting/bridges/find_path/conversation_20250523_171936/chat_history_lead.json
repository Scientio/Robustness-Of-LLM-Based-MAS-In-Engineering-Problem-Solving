A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

For an Eulerian path to exist, the graph must have exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. \n\nLet's analyze the degrees of the islands:\n- Island A is connected to B (3 bridges) \u2192 degree 3 (odd)\n- Island B is connected to A (3 bridges) and C (3 bridges) \u2192 degree 6 (even)\n- Island C is connected to B (3 bridges) and D (3 bridges) \u2192 degree 6 (even)\n- Island D is connected to C (3 bridges) \u2192 degree 3 (odd)\n\nWe have two islands (A and D) with odd degrees, which means an Eulerian path is possible.\n\nA possible path that crosses every bridge exactly once is:\n1. Start at Island A\n2. Cross to Island B\n3. Cross to Island C\n4. Cross to Island D\n5. Cross back to Island C\n6. Cross to Island B\n7. Cross to Island A\n8. Cross to Island B\n9. Cross to Island C\n10. Cross to Island D\n\nThis path uses all the bridges exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: Start at A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D."
