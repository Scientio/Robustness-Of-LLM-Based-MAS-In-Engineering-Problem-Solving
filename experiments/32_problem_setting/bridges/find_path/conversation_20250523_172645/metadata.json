An Eulerian path exists in a graph if it has exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. \n\nIn this case:\n- A has a degree of 3 (odd)\n- B has a degree of 6 (even)\n- C has a degree of 6 (even)\n- D has a degree of 3 (odd)\n\nSince there are exactly two vertices (A and D) with an odd degree, an Eulerian path exists. \n\nA possible Eulerian path could be:\n1.
