An Eulerian path exists if and only if there are exactly zero or two vertices with an odd degree.\n\n1. **Degree of each island**:\n   - Island A: connected to B (3 bridges) \u2192 degree 3\n   - Island B: connected to A (3 bridges) and C (3 bridges) \u2192 degree 6\n   - Island C: connected to B (3 bridges) and D (3 bridges) \u2192 degree 6\n   - Island D: connected to C (3 bridges) \u2192 degree 3\n\n2. **Odd degree vertices**: \n   - A (3) and D (3) have odd degrees.\n   - B and C have even degrees.\n\nSince there are exactly two vertices with an odd degree (A and D), an Eulerian path exists. \n\n3. **Finding the path**:\n   Start at one of the odd degree vertices (A) and aim to end at the other (D). The possible path can be constructed as follows:\n\n- Start at A, cross to B (3 bridges available; choose one)\n- From B, cross to C (3 bridges available; choose one)\n- From C, cross to D (3 bridges available; choose one)\n- From D, cross back to C (2 remaining bridges)\n- From C, cross back to B (2 remaining bridges)\n- From B, cross back to A (2 remaining bridges)\n- Cross again from A to B (1 remaining bridge)\n- Cross from B to C (1 remaining bridge)\n- Cross from C to D (1 remaining bridge)\n\nThis ensures each bridge is crossed exactly once.\n\n**Preliminary Decision: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D** (crossing each bridge exactly once)."
