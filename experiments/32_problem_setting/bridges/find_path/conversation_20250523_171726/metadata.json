I noted that an Eulerian path exists when there are exactly two vertices with odd degrees. In this case, vertices A and D had odd degrees, confirming the existence of an Eulerian path.\n\n**Contribution to the Final Decision**: After establishing that an Eulerian path exists, I constructed a path that begins at one of the odd degree vertices (A) and ends at the other (D). I aimed to ensure that each bridge was crossed exactly once. The final proposed path was A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D, which successfully covers all connections while adhering to the Eulerian path criteria.\n\nUltimately, my contribution was crucial in confirming the structure of the path and ensuring that it met the requirements of the problem, leading to a clear and valid traversal of the graph.",
