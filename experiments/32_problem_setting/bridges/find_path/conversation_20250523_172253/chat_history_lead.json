Identify the connections:\n   - A to B: 3 bridges\n   - B to C: 3 bridges\n   - C to D: 3 bridges\n\n2. Count the degree of each vertex (island):\n   - A: 3 (connected to B)\n   - B: 6 (connected to A and C)\n   - C: 6 (connected to B and D)\n   - D: 3 (connected to C)\n\n3. An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. Here, A and D have an odd degree (3), while B and C have even degrees.\n\n4. Start at one of the odd degree vertices (A or D). Let's start at A.\n\n5. A possible path could be:\n   - A to B (1)\n   - A to B (2)\n   - A to B (3)\n   - B to C (1)\n   - B to C (2)\n   - B to C (3)\n   - C to D (1)\n   - C to D (2)\n   - C to D (3)\n\nThis path crosses each bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The path is A \u2192 B (3 times) \u2192 C (3 times) \u2192 D (3 times)."
