We have two vertices (A and D) with an odd degree, which means an Eulerian path exists.\n\n3.

Remember, the goal is to keep looping between B and C after starting at A. So, the corrected path would be:\n\n- Start at A\n- A to B\n- B to C\n- C to B\n- B to C\n- Repeat...\n\nThis way, we can maintain the continuity and ensure we cover the required connections efficiently."

The proposed sequence is as follows:\n\n1. Start at A\n2. A to B (1st bridge)\n3. B to C (2nd bridge)\n4. C to D (3rd bridge)\n5. D to C (4th bridge)\n6. C to B (5th bridge)\n7. B to A (6th bridge)\n8. A to B (7th bridge)\n9. B to C (8th bridge)\n10. C to D (9th bridge)\n\nThis path effectively uses all bridges without repetition. \n\nYour suggestion of repeatedly looping between B and C does not satisfy the requirement of crossing each bridge exactly once. \n\nFinal Decision: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D"
