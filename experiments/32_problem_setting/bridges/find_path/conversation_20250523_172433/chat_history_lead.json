For an Eulerian path to exist, at most two vertices can have an odd degree.\n\n1. **Identify the connections:**\n   - A to B: 3 bridges (degree 3)\n   - B to C: 3 bridges (degree 3)\n   - C to D: 3 bridges (degree 3)\n\n2. **Degree of each island:**\n   - A: 3 (odd)\n   - B: 6 (even)\n   - C: 6 (even)\n   - D: 3 (odd)\n\nSince there are two islands (A and D) with an odd degree, we can find an Eulerian path starting from one of the odd degree vertices (A or D) and ending at the other (D or A).\n\n3. **Construct the path:**\n   Starting from A, we can outline a path as follows:\n   - A \u2192 B (1st bridge)\n   - A \u2192 B (2nd bridge)\n   - A \u2192 B (3rd bridge)\n   - B \u2192 C (1st bridge)\n   - B \u2192 C (2nd bridge)\n   - B \u2192 C (3rd bridge)\n   - C \u2192 D (1st bridge)\n   - C \u2192 D (2nd bridge)\n   - C \u2192 D (3rd bridge)\n\nThis path crosses every bridge exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: A \u2192 B (3 times), B \u2192 C (3 times), C \u2192 D (3 times)."

An Eulerian path must visit each edge exactly once, and your proposed sequence involves returning over the same bridges multiple times, which contradicts the problem's constraints.\n\nThe correct path must utilize each of the three bridges between A and B, the three bridges between B and C, and the three bridges between C and D without retracing any steps.\n\nThus, the correct path remains:\n\n1.
