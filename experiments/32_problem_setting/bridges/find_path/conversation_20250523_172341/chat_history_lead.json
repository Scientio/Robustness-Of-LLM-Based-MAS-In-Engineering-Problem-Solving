A is connected to B , B is connected to C and C is connected to D, each by each three bridges. You can only move between the islands by crossing these bridges. Determine a path step by step that crosses every bridge exactly once (not 0, not twice). "

        "content": "This problem can be modeled as an Eulerian path problem in graph theory. An Eulerian path exists in a graph if it has exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. In this case:\n\n- Island A connects to B (3 bridges) - degree 3 (odd)\n- Island B connects to A (3 bridges) and C (3 bridges) - degree 6 (even)\n- Island C connects to B (3 bridges) and D (3 bridges) - degree 6 (even)\n- Island D connects to C (3 bridges) - degree 3 (odd)\n\nIslands A and D have odd degrees, while B and C have even degrees. Since there are exactly two vertices of odd degree, an Eulerian path exists, starting at one odd vertex (A) and ending at the other (D).\n\nThe path can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. Start at A\n2. Cross a bridge to B\n3. Cross a bridge to C\n4. Cross a bridge to D\n5. Cross a bridge back to C\n6. Cross a bridge to B\n7. Cross a bridge to A\n8. Cross another bridge to B\n9. Cross to C\n10. Cross back to D\n11. Cross back to C\n12. Cross back to B\n13. Cross to A\n14. Cross to B\n15. Cross to C\n16. Cross back to D\n\nThis ensures that each bridge is crossed exactly once.\n\nPreliminary Decision: The path is A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D, ensuring all bridges are crossed exactly once."
