Here, A and D have an odd degree (3), while B and C have an even degree (4).\n\n4. **Starting point**:\n   - We can start at either A or D since they have an odd degree.\n\n5. **Construct the path**:\n   Starting from A:\n   - A to B (1st bridge)\n   - A to B (2nd bridge)\n   - A to B (3rd bridge)\n   - B to C (1st bridge)\n   - B to C (2nd bridge)\n   - B to C (3rd bridge)\n   - C to D (1st bridge)\n   - C to D (2nd bridge)\n   - C to D (3rd bridge)\n\nThis path crosses each bridge exactly once. \n\nPreliminary Decision: The path is A-B-B-B-C-C-C-D-D-D."
