The islands (A, B, C, D) are the vertices, and the bridges between them are the edges.\n\nThe connections are as follows:\n- A to B: 3 bridges\n- B to C: 3 bridges\n- C to D: 3 bridges\n\nThis creates a multigraph with the following edges:\n- A-B (3)\n- B-C (3)\n- C-D (3)\n\nTo find a path that crosses every bridge exactly once, we need to check if an Eulerian path exists. An Eulerian path exists in a graph if at most two vertices have an odd degree. \n\nCalculating the degree of each vertex:\n- Degree of A = 3 (connected to B)\n- Degree of B = 6 (3 to A and 3 to C)\n- Degree of C = 6 (3 to B and 3 to D)\n- Degree of D = 3 (connected to C)\n\nVertices A and D have an odd degree. Therefore, an Eulerian path exists and must start at one of the odd degree vertices (A or D) and end at the other (D or A).\n\nOne possible path starting from A could be:\n1. A to B (1st bridge)\n2. A to B (2nd bridge)\n3. A to B (3rd bridge)\n4. B to C (1st bridge)\n5. B to C (2nd bridge)\n6. B to C (3rd bridge)\n7. C to D (1st bridge)\n8. C to D (2nd bridge)\n9.

My reasoning was based on the graph theory principles governing Eulerian paths, leading to the conclusion that the path I initially proposed was indeed valid for the given constraints. \n\nFinal Decision: The correct path is A-B-B-B-C-C-C-D-D-D, which crosses every bridge exactly once.",
