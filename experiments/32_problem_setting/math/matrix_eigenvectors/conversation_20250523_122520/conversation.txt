##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[ 
A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} 
\]

To solve this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by calculating the characteristic polynomial, which is given by:

\[ 
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0 
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues. 

Let's start by calculating the characteristic polynomial:

\[ 
A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{bmatrix} 
\]

Now, we compute the determinant:

\[ 
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2)(1) 
\]

Simplifying this will give us a quadratic equation in \( \lambda \). After finding the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into \( A - \lambda I \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.

I suggest we start calculating the determinant now. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
Absolutely, let's proceed with calculating the determinant. 

Starting from:

\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
= (12 - 4\lambda - 3\lambda + \lambda^2 - 2) = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10
\]

Setting this equal to zero to find the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Factoring, we get:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \). 

Next, we can substitute these eigenvalues back into \( A - \lambda I \) to find the eigenvectors. 

For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):

\[
A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to the equation \( -x + y = 0 \), leading us to the eigenvector \( [1; 1] \).

For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):

\[
A - 2I = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to \( 2x + y = 0 \), leading us to the eigenvector \( [1; -2] \).

So, the eigenvectors are \( [1; 1] \) and \( [1; -2] \). Let's finalize this!

In this discussion, my role was to guide the team through the process of finding the eigenvectors of a given matrix. I initiated the conversation by explaining the steps needed to find the eigenvalues, which are crucial for determining the eigenvectors.

My reasoning involved breaking down the problem into manageable parts, starting with the calculation of the characteristic polynomial. After we derived the polynomial and found the eigenvalues, I suggested substituting these values back into the equation \(A - \lambda I\) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.
