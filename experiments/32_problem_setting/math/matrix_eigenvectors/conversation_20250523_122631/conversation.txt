##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

To solve this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by calculating the characteristic polynomial, which is given by:

\[ \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0 \]

Where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues. Once we find the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into the equation \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors \( v \).

Let's calculate the determinant:

1. Set up the equation:
   \[ A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \]

2. Calculate the determinant:
   \[ (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2)(1) = 0 \]

3. Expand and simplify to find \( \lambda \).

Once we have the eigenvalues, we can find the eigenvectors. Does anyone have suggestions or insights on how to proceed with the calculations?
##### ADVISOR:
To find the eigenvalues, letâ€™s calculate the determinant as you outlined:

1. The characteristic polynomial is:
   \[
   (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 = 0
   \]

2. Expanding this gives:
   \[
   12 - 4\lambda - 3\lambda + \lambda^2 - 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
   \]

3. Factoring, we get:
   \[
   (\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
   \]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

Now, substituting these values back into \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) will give us the eigenvectors.

For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):
\[
A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{bmatrix}
\]
This simplifies to the equation \( -v_1 + v_2 = 0 \) or \( v_2 = v_1 \). Thus, one eigenvector is \( v_1 = [1; 1] \).

For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):
\[
A - 2I = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
This simplifies to the equation \( 2v_1 + v_2 = 0 \) or \( v_2 = -2v_1 \). Thus, another eigenvector is \( v_2 = [1; -2] \).

So, our eigenvectors are \( [1; 1] \) and \( [1; -2] \). Let me know if you need any more details!
##### LEAD:
Your calculations for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are correct. 

To summarize:
1. The eigenvalues of the matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \) are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).
2. The corresponding eigenvectors are \( v_1 = [1; 1] \) for \( \lambda_1 \) and \( v_2 = [1; -2] \) for \( \lambda_2 \).

These results are consistent with the calculations we've made.
