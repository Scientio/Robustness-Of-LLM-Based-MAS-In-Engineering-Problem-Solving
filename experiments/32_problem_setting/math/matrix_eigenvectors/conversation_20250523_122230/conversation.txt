##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \]

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic polynomial, which is given by:

\[ \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0 \]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues. 

Once we find the eigenvalues, we can find the eigenvectors by solving the equation:

\[ (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \]

for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \), where \( v \) is the eigenvector.

Can anyone provide insights or suggestions on this approach?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach is correct! Let's go through it step by step.

1. **Find the characteristic polynomial**: We start with the matrix \( A \) and set up the equation:
   \[
   A - \lambda I = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the determinant:
   \[
   \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2)(1) = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10
   \]

2. **Solve for eigenvalues**: Setting the determinant to zero:
   \[
   \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
   \]
   Factoring gives us:
   \[
   (\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

3. **Find the eigenvectors**: Now we substitute each eigenvalue back into the equation \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \).

   - For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):
     \[
     (A - 5I)v = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix} v = 0
     \]
     This leads to the eigenvector \( v_1 = [1; 1] \).

   - For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):
     \[
     (A - 2I)v = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} v = 0
     \]
     This gives us the eigenvector \( v_2 = [1; 2] \).

So, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues are indeed \( [1; 1] \) and \( [1; 2] \). Great job on the approach!

To summarize our findings:

1. We found the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \) to be \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).
2. The corresponding eigenvectors are \( v_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) for \( \lambda_1 \) and \( v_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \) for \( \lambda_2 \).

Preliminary Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \( A \) are \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \).

##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
Final Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \) are:

##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
In this discussion, my role was to guide the team through the process of finding the eigenvectors of the matrix \( A \). I provided a structured approach that involved first calculating the eigenvalues using the characteristic polynomial, and then determining the corresponding eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

My reasoning was based on the standard procedure for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which includes setting up the determinant equation and solving for the eigenvalues, followed by substituting these eigenvalues back into the equation \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the eigenvectors.

I contributed to the final decision by:

1. Confirming the correctness of the initial approach laid out by the team.
2. Performing the calculations for the determinant and eigenvalues.
3. Solving for the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.
4. Presenting the final eigenvectors clearly, which are \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \).

This collaborative effort ensured that we arrived at the correct conclusion regarding the eigenvectors of the matrix \( A \).
