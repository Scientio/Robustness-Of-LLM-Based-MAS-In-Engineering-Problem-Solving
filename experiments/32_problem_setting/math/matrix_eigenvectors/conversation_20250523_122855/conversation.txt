##### LEAD:
Alright team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
4 & 1 \\
2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\]

To do this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is given by:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0
\]

Where \( \lambda \) is the eigenvalue and \( I \) is the identity matrix. This leads us to the equation:

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}
4 - \lambda & 1 \\
2 & 3 - \lambda
\end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

Next, we will compute the determinant and find the eigenvalues. Once we have the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into the equation \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.

I suggest we start by calculating the determinant. Does anyone have thoughts on this approach or any other suggestions?
##### ADVISOR:
Great plan! Let's compute the determinant of the matrix \( A - \lambda I \):

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}
4 - \lambda & 1 \\
2 & 3 - \lambda
\end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (1)(2)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 = 12 - 4\lambda - 3\lambda + \lambda^2 - 2 = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10
\]

Now we set this equal to zero to find the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Factoring this gives us:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

Next, we can find the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues. For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):

\[
(A - 5I)v = 0
\]

This gives us:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\
2 & -2
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2
\end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

From this, we find that \( x_1 = x_2 \), leading us to the eigenvector:

\[
v_1 = k\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):

\[
(A - 2I)v = 0
\]

This results in:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
2 & 1
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2
\end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

From this, we find \( x_1 = -\frac{1}{2}x_2 \), leading to the eigenvector:

\[
v_2 = k\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
-2
\end{pmatrix}
\]

So, the eigenvectors are \( [1;1] \) and \( [1;-2] \). Let's move forward with these results!
##### LEAD:
Great work, team! We've successfully found the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. To summarize:

1. The eigenvalues are:
   - \( \lambda_1 = 5 \)
   - \( \lambda_2 = 2 \)

2. The corresponding eigenvectors are:
   - For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \): \( v_1 = k\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)
   - For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \): \( v_2 = k\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

These eigenvectors can be scaled by any non-zero constant \( k \).

Preliminary Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}\) are \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing our solution, everything appears to be consistent and accurate. We correctly calculated the eigenvalues and derived the corresponding eigenvectors. 

1. We confirmed that the eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \) were obtained by solving the characteristic polynomial \( \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0 \).
2. We derived the eigenvectors from the equations \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) for both eigenvalues, leading to:
   - \( v_1 = k\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)
   - \( v_2 = k\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

Since all steps were followed correctly and the results are consistent with our calculations, I can confidently state:

Final Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}\) are \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).
