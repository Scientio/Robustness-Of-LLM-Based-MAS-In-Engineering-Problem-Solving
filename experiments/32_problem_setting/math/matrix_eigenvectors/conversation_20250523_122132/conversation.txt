##### LEAD:
Team, we need to determine the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

To solve this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is derived from the determinant of \( A - \lambda I = 0 \), where \( \lambda \) is the eigenvalue and \( I \) is the identity matrix.

1. We calculate \( A - \lambda I \):
   \[ A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \]

2. Next, we find the determinant:
   \[ \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 \cdot 1 \]

3. Setting the determinant to zero gives us the characteristic polynomial. We can then solve for \( \lambda \) to find the eigenvalues.

4. Once we have the eigenvalues, we substitute each eigenvalue back into \( A - \lambda I \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.

I suggest we start by calculating the eigenvalues first. Does anyone have insights or suggestions on this approach?
##### ADVISOR:
I appreciate your detailed breakdown! Let's proceed with the calculations. 

1. For the determinant, we have:
   \[
   \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10
   \]

2. Setting the characteristic polynomial to zero:
   \[
   \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
   \]

3. Factoring gives us:
   \[
   (\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

4. Now for the eigenvectors:
   - For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):
     \[
     A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{bmatrix}
     \]
     Solving this gives us the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda_1 \) as \( [1; 1] \).

   - For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):
     \[
     A - 2I = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
     \]
     This yields the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda_2 \) as \( [1; 2] \).

Letâ€™s summarize: the eigenvectors are \( [1; 1] \) and \( [1; 2] \). This method seems effective! What do you think?
##### LEAD:
Your calculations are correct, and the approach you've taken is solid. 

To summarize:
- The eigenvalues we found are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).
- The corresponding eigenvectors are \( [1; 1] \) for \( \lambda_1 \) and \( [1; 2] \) for \( \lambda_2 \).

This confirms that we have accurately derived the eigenvectors from the eigenvalues. 

Preliminary Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \( \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \) are \( [1; 1] \) and \( [1; 2] \). 

Do you have any further questions or points to discuss?
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \( \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \) are \( [1; 1] \) and \( [1; 2] \).
