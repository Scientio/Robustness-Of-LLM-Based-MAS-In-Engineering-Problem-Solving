##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \]

To solve this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by calculating the characteristic polynomial, which is given by the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues.

The characteristic polynomial is:

\[ \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = \text{det}\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Calculating this determinant will give us a quadratic equation in \( \lambda \). Once we find the eigenvalues, we can substitute each eigenvalue back into the equation \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.

I suggest we start by calculating the determinant to find the eigenvalues. What do you all think? Any other suggestions or insights?
##### ADVISOR:
I completely agree with your approach! Let's calculate the determinant to find the eigenvalues. 

For the matrix \( A - \lambda I \):

\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2)(1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10
\]

Setting this to zero gives us the characteristic polynomial:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Factoring this, we find:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

Next, we can substitute these eigenvalues back into \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the eigenvectors. For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \), we'll find the corresponding eigenvectors. 

Let's proceed with this!
##### LEAD:
Great work on calculating the eigenvalues! Now, let's find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

1. **For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \)**:

We substitute \( \lambda = 5 \) into the equation \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \):

\[
A - 5I = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 5 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we solve the system:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the equation \( -x_1 + x_2 = 0 \), or \( x_2 = x_1 \). Thus, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) can be expressed as:

\[
v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \text{ for any scalar } k \neq 0.
\]

2. **For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \)**:

Next, we substitute \( \lambda = 2 \):

\[
A - 2I = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Again, we solve:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to \( 2x_1 + x_2 = 0 \), or \( x_2 = -2x_1 \). Thus, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda_2 = 2 \) can be expressed as:

\[
v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}, \text{ for any scalar } k \neq 0.
\]

In summary, we have:

- Eigenvector for \( \lambda_1 = 5 \): \( v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)
- Eigenvector for \( \lambda_2 = 2 \): \( v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

Preliminary Decision: Eigenvectors are \( v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing our calculations and reasoning, everything appears to be consistent and accurate. We successfully computed the eigenvalues and derived the corresponding eigenvectors for the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \).

To summarize:

1. We calculated the characteristic polynomial, found the eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).
2. We derived the eigenvectors:
   - For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \): \( v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)
   - For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \): \( v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

Since the calculations are verified and there are no uncertainties, I can confidently state:

Final Decision: Eigenvectors are \( v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).
