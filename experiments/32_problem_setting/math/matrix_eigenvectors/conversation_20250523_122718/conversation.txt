##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
4 & 1 \\
2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\]

To do this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is given by:

\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues. 

Let's calculate the determinant:

\[
A - \lambda I = \begin{pmatrix}
4 - \lambda & 1 \\
2 & 3 - \lambda
\end{pmatrix}
\]

The determinant is:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2)(1) = 0
\]

Now, I'll calculate the determinant and set it to zero. 

Once we find the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into the equation \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors \( v \).

Can anyone assist with the calculation of the eigenvalues or provide insights on this approach?
##### ADVISOR:
Sure! Let's calculate the determinant step by step:

The determinant of \( A - \lambda I \) is given by:

\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2)(1)
\]

Expanding this, we have:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) = 12 - 4\lambda - 3\lambda + \lambda^2 = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 12
\]

Now, subtracting 2:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 12 - 2 = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10
\]

Setting the determinant to zero gives us the characteristic equation:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Now we can factor this equation:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda_1 = 5, \quad \lambda_2 = 2
\]

Next, we can find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. 

For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):

\[
(A - 5I)v = 0 \Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\
2 & -2
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2
\end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

This simplifies to the equation \( -x_1 + x_2 = 0 \), giving us \( x_2 = x_1 \). Therefore, one eigenvector is:

\[
v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):

\[
(A - 2I)v = 0 \Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
2 & 1
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2
\end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

This simplifies to \( 2x_1 + x_2 = 0 \), giving us \( x_2 = -2x_1 \). Therefore, another eigenvector is:

\[
v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
-2
\end{pmatrix}
\]

So, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues are:

- For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \): \( v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)
- For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \): \( v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

Let me know if you need further assistance!

1. We found the eigenvalues:
   - \( \lambda_1 = 5 \)

2. The corresponding eigenvectors are:
   - For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \): \( v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)
