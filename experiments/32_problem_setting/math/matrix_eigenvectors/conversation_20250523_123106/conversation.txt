##### LEAD:
The problem at hand is to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
4 & 1 \\
2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\]

To solve this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is derived from the determinant of \(A - \lambda I = 0\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\lambda\) represents the eigenvalues.

The characteristic polynomial is given by:

\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = \text{det}\begin{pmatrix}
4 - \lambda & 1 \\
2 & 3 - \lambda
\end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Next, we can find the eigenvalues by solving this quadratic equation. After obtaining the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into \(A - \lambda I\) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.

I suggest we first calculate the eigenvalues. What are your thoughts on this approach?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach is solid. Let's go ahead and solve the characteristic polynomial:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Factoring gives us:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda_1 = 5, \quad \lambda_2 = 2
\]

Now, we can find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. For \(\lambda_1 = 5\):

\[
A - 5I = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\
2 & -2
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to the equation:

\[
-x + y = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = x
\]

So, one eigenvector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, for \(\lambda_2 = 2\):

\[
A - 2I = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
2 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x + y = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -2x
\]

Thus, the corresponding eigenvector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

So the eigenvectors are:

1. For \(\lambda_1 = 5\): \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\)
2. For \(\lambda_2 = 2\): \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\)

This gives us the complete set of eigenvectors!
##### LEAD:
Your calculations for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are correct. 

To summarize:

1. The eigenvalues are:
   - \(\lambda_1 = 5\)
   - \(\lambda_2 = 2\)

2. The corresponding eigenvectors are:
   - For \(\lambda_1 = 5\): \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\)
   - For \(\lambda_2 = 2\): \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\)

This confirms our findings. 

Preliminary Decision: Eigenvectors are \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_1 = 5\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_2 = 2\).
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}\) are \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_1 = 5\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_2 = 2\).
