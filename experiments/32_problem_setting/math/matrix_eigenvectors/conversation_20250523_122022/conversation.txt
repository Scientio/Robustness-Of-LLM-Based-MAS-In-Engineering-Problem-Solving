##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 1 \\
2 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To solve this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is given by:

\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the eigenvalue and \( I \) is the identity matrix. The determinant can be computed as follows:

\[
\text{det}\left(\begin{bmatrix}
4 - \lambda & 1 \\
2 & 3 - \lambda
\end{bmatrix}\right) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2)(1) = 0
\]

Let's calculate this determinant and find the eigenvalues. After that, we can find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. Does anyone have suggestions on how to proceed with the calculations or any insights on finding the eigenvectors once we have the eigenvalues?
##### ADVISOR:
To find the eigenvalues, let's solve the characteristic equation:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 = 0
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
(12 - 4\lambda - 3\lambda + \lambda^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Now, we can factor or use the quadratic formula. Factoring gives us:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda_1 = 5, \quad \lambda_2 = 2
\]

Next, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):

\[
A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\
2 & -2
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Solving \( (A - 5I)\mathbf{v} = 0 \) gives us the eigenvector:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\
2 & -2
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2
\end{bmatrix} = 0 \implies x_1 = x_2
\]

Letting \( x_2 = 1 \), we have the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):

\[
A - 2I = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Solving \( (A - 2I)\mathbf{v} = 0 \) gives us:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
2 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2
\end{bmatrix} = 0 \implies 2x_1 + x_2 = 0 \implies x_2 = -2x_1
\]

Letting \( x_1 = 1 \), we have the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \).

Therefore, the eigenvalues are \( 5 \) and \( 2 \), with corresponding eigenvectors:

\[
\mathbf{v_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{v_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}
\]
##### LEAD:
Great work on calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors! 

To summarize:

1. We found the eigenvalues:
   - \( \lambda_1 = 5 \)
   - \( \lambda_2 = 2 \)

2. Corresponding eigenvectors:
   - For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \): \( \mathbf{v_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)
   - For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \): \( \mathbf{v_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \)

This confirms that our calculations are correct.
