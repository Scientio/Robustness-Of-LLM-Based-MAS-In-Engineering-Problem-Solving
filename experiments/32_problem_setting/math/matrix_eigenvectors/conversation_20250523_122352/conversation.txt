##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \]

To do this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is derived from the determinant of \( A - \lambda I = 0 \), where \( \lambda \) is the eigenvalue and \( I \) is the identity matrix.

1. Calculate \( A - \lambda I \):
   \[ A - \lambda I = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

2. Find the determinant:
   \[ \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2 \cdot 1) = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 \]

3. Set the determinant to zero and solve for \( \lambda \):
   \[ \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0 \]

Next, we can find the eigenvalues and then determine the corresponding eigenvectors.

I need your advice on this approach. Do you see any steps that need adjustment or improvement?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach is solid, but there's a slight oversight in the final determinant calculation. The correct determinant should be:

\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2 \cdot 1) = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10
\]

This part is correct, and solving the characteristic equation \( \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0 \) will yield the eigenvalues. 

Once you solve for \( \lambda \), you should find the eigenvalues to be \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \). 

Now, for the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues:

1. For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):
   \[
   (A - 5I)v = 0 \Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0
   \]
   This leads to the eigenvector \( v_1 = [1; 1] \).

2. For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):
   \[
   (A - 2I)v = 0 \Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0
   \]
   This leads to the eigenvector \( v_2 = [1; 2] \).

So, your final eigenvectors are indeed \( [1; 1] \) and \( [1; 2] \). Great work!
##### LEAD:
Thank you for your input. Let's summarize the findings clearly:

1. We correctly determined the characteristic polynomial:
   \[ \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0 \]
   The eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

2. For the eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 = 5 \), we found the eigenvector:
   \[ v_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

3. For the eigenvalue \( \lambda_2 = 2 \), we found the eigenvector:
   \[ v_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \]
