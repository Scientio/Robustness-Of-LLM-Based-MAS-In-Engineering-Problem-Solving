##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \]

To do this, we'll first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic polynomial, which is determined from the equation:

\[ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues. 

After finding the eigenvalues, we can substitute each eigenvalue back into the equation:

\[ (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \]

to find the corresponding eigenvectors \( v \).

I suggest we start by calculating the characteristic polynomial. Does anyone have any advice or input on this approach?
##### ADVISOR:
Your approach is spot on! To find the eigenvalues, we first calculate the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \):

\[
A - \lambda I = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we compute the determinant:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2)(1) = (\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10)
\]

Setting the determinant equal to zero gives us the characteristic polynomial:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Factoring this, we find:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

Next, we substitute each eigenvalue back into \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the eigenvectors. For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):

\[
(A - 5I)v = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix} v = 0
\]

This leads to the eigenvector \( v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) for any scalar \( k \).

For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):

\[
(A - 2I)v = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} v = 0
\]

This gives us the eigenvector \( v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

So, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues are \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \). This should align well with our findings!
##### LEAD:
Your calculations and reasoning are correct! We have successfully found the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors for the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \).

To summarize:

1. The eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).
2. The corresponding eigenvectors are:
   - For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \): \( v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)
   - For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \): \( v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

This confirms our solution. 

Preliminary Decision: Eigenvectors are \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) for \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \) for \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \) are \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) corresponding to the eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \) corresponding to the eigenvalue \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).
