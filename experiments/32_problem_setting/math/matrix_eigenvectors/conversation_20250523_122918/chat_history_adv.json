We set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\det(A - \\lambda I) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 - \\lambda & 1 \\\\\n2 & 3 - \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n2. This leads to the characteristic polynomial:\n\\[\n(4 - \\lambda)(3 - \\lambda) - 2 = \\lambda^2 - 7\\lambda + 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n3. We can find the eigenvalues by solving this quadratic equation. Once we have the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into \\(A - \\lambda I\\) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nNow, I would like your input on the next steps. Should we proceed with finding the eigenvalues and then the eigenvectors, or is there a different approach you recommend?"
