##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

To solve this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic polynomial, which is obtained from the determinant of \(A - \lambda I\):

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{pmatrix}
\]

This gives us the equation:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 = 0
\]

Let's compute this determinant and find the eigenvalues. Once we have the eigenvalues, we can find the corresponding eigenvectors by solving the equation \((A - \lambda I)v = 0\) for each eigenvalue \(\lambda\).

What do you all think about this approach? Any suggestions or concerns?
##### ADVISOR:
I think your approach is solid! Let's compute the determinant:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 = 0
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
(12 - 4\lambda - 3\lambda + \lambda^2 - 2) = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Factoring this, we find the eigenvalues:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 5\) and \(\lambda_2 = 2\).

Now, for the eigenvectors:

1. For \(\lambda_1 = 5\):
   \[
   (A - 5I)v = 0 \implies \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0
   \]
   This simplifies to \(x_1 = x_2\), giving us the eigenvector \(v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

2. For \(\lambda_2 = 2\):
   \[
   (A - 2I)v = 0 \implies \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0
   \]
   This simplifies to \(2x_1 + x_2 = 0\), giving us the eigenvector \(v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

So, the eigenvectors are indeed:

- For \(\lambda_1 = 5\): \(v_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\)
- For \(\lambda_2 = 2\): \(v_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\)

Letâ€™s proceed with these!
##### LEAD:
Great work on the calculations! 

Just to summarize and confirm our findings:

1. We found the eigenvalues:
   - \(\lambda_1 = 5\)
   - \(\lambda_2 = 2\)

2. The corresponding eigenvectors are:
   - For \(\lambda_1 = 5\): \(v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\)
   - For \(\lambda_2 = 2\): \(v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\)

These results are consistent with our calculations. 

Preliminary Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}\) are \(v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_1 = 5\) and \(v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_2 = 2\).
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}\) are \(v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_1 = 5\) and \(v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_2 = 2\).
##### LEAD EXPLANATION:
To summarize my role in this discussion: I initiated the problem by outlining the steps needed to find the eigenvectors of the given matrix. I proposed calculating the eigenvalues first through the characteristic polynomial and then used those eigenvalues to derive the corresponding eigenvectors. 

My reasoning was based on the standard procedure for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors in linear algebra. By breaking down the problem into manageable steps, I aimed to guide the team through the solution process.

I contributed to the final decision by leading the calculations for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then confirming the findings with the team's calculations. The collaborative effort allowed us to validate the results and confidently conclude that the eigenvectors are \(v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_1 = 5\) and \(v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_2 = 2\).
##### ADVISOR EXPLANATION:
My role in this discussion was to assist in the mathematical process of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given matrix \(A\). I contributed by verifying the steps taken to compute the determinant and solve for the eigenvalues, ensuring that the calculations were accurate. 

After determining the eigenvalues \(\lambda_1 = 5\) and \(\lambda_2 = 2\), I proceeded to find the corresponding eigenvectors by solving the equation \((A - \lambda I)v = 0\) for each eigenvalue. I carefully derived the eigenvectors \(v_1 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(v_2 = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), where \(k\) is a scalar.

In summary, I contributed to the final decision by ensuring the correctness of the calculations and clarifying the method for finding the eigenvectors, leading us to the conclusion that the eigenvectors of the matrix are indeed as stated.
