Once we have the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into \\( (A - \\lambda I)v = 0 \\) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nDo we agree with this approach, or does anyone have alternative suggestions?"

Once we factor the characteristic equation \\( \\lambda^2 - 7\\lambda + 10 = 0 \\), we find the eigenvalues to be \\( \\lambda_1 = 5 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = 2 \\). \n\nNow, substituting these eigenvalues back into \\( (A - \\lambda I)v = 0 \\) will yield the eigenvectors. \n\nFor \\( \\lambda_1 = 5 \\):\n\\[ \nA - 5I = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \n\\]\nThis leads us to the eigenvector \\( v_1 = [1; 1] \\).\n\nFor \\( \\lambda_2 = 2 \\):\n\\[ \nA - 2I = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \n\\]\nThis gives us the eigenvector \\( v_2 = [1; 2] \\).\n\nSo, the eigenvectors are \\( [1; 1] \\) and \\( [1; 2] \\).
