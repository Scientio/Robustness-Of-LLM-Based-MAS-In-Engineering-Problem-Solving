##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

To solve this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic polynomial, which is given by:

\[ \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0 \]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues. After finding the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into the equation \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.

Let's proceed with finding the eigenvalues first. What do you all think about this approach?
##### ADVISOR:
That sounds like a solid approach! Let's start by calculating the characteristic polynomial. 

We compute \( A - \lambda I \):

\[
A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{bmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the determinant:

\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = (4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (2)(1) = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10
\]

Setting this equal to zero gives us the characteristic equation:

\[
\lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Factoring this, we find the eigenvalues:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

So, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

Now, we can substitute these eigenvalues back into \( (A - \lambda I)v = 0 \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors. Let's focus on \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) first. 

Substituting \( \lambda_1 \):

\[
A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]

From here, we can see that the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) is any scalar multiple of \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

Next, for \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):

\[
A - 2I = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda_2 = 2 \) is any scalar multiple of \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \).

So, the eigenvectors are \( [1;1] \) and \( [1;2] \). What do you think?
##### LEAD:
There's a small error in the eigenvector for \( \lambda_2 = 2 \). The correct eigenvector should be derived from the equation:

\[
A - 2I = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

This gives us the system of equations:

1. \( 2x + y = 0 \)
2. \( 2x + y = 0 \) (redundant)

From the first equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[
y = -2x
\]

Thus, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda_2 = 2 \) can be represented as any scalar multiple of:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

So, the correct eigenvectors for our matrix are:

1. For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \): \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)
2. For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \): \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \)

Preliminary Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \( \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \) are \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \).
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the solution, the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors are correctly identified. 

1. The eigenvalues calculated were:
   - \( \lambda_1 = 5 \)
   - \( \lambda_2 = 2 \)

2. The eigenvectors derived from the equations were:
   - For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \): \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)
   - For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \): \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \)

This confirms that the eigenvectors are indeed correct as stated. 

Final Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \( \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \) are \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \).
