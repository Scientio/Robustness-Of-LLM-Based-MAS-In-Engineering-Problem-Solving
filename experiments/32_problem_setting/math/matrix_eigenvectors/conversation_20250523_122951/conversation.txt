##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix:

\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \]

To do this, we first need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic polynomial, which is derived from the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) is the eigenvalue. 

The characteristic polynomial is given by:

\[ \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0 \]

This leads us to the equation:

\[ \text{det}\left(\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{pmatrix}\right) = 0 \]

Calculating the determinant, we get:

\[(4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 \cdot 1 = 0\]

Expanding this will give us a quadratic equation in terms of \( \lambda \). Once we find the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into \( A - \lambda I \) to find the corresponding eigenvectors.

I suggest we proceed with calculating the eigenvalues first. Does anyone have insights or suggestions on this approach?
##### ADVISOR:
Let's go ahead with calculating the eigenvalues. From the determinant calculation, we have:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - 2 = 0
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
(12 - 4\lambda - 3\lambda + \lambda^2 - 2) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0
\]

Factoring this quadratic, we find:

\[
(\lambda - 5)(\lambda - 2) = 0
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

Now, for the eigenvectors, we substitute each eigenvalue back into \( A - \lambda I \):

1. For \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):

\[
A - 5I = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
-x + y = 0 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
2x - 2y = 0 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

From equation (1), we get \( y = x \). Thus, one eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

2. For \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):

\[
A - 2I = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system:

\[
2x + y = 0 \quad \text{(3)}
\]
\[
2x + y = 0 \quad \text{(4)}
\]

From equation (3), we find \( y = -2x \). Thus, another eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues are \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \). Letâ€™s proceed with these results!
##### LEAD:
Preliminary Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}\) are \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_1 = 5\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_2 = 2\).
##### RETHINKING:
Upon reviewing the calculations for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors:

1. The eigenvalues were correctly determined as \( \lambda_1 = 5 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \) from the characteristic polynomial \( \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 10 = 0 \), which factored correctly.

2. For the eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 = 5 \):
   - The matrix \( A - 5I \) was correctly computed as \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The equations derived were accurate, leading to the eigenvector \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. For the eigenvalue \( \lambda_2 = 2 \):
   - The matrix \( A - 2I \) was computed correctly as \( \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The resulting equations were also accurate, leading to the eigenvector \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

After thoroughly checking the calculations and reasoning, everything appears to be correct.

Final Decision: The eigenvectors of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}\) are \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_1 = 5\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) for \(\lambda_2 = 2\).
