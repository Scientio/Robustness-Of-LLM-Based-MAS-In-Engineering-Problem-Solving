Form the matrix A - \u03bbI = [4 - \u03bb, 1; 2, 3 - \u03bb].\n2. Calculate the determinant: (4 - \u03bb)(3 - \u03bb) - (2)(1) = 0.\n3. Simplify this to find the eigenvalues.\n\nOnce we have the eigenvalues, we can substitute them back into the equation (A - \u03bbI)v = 0 to find the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nDoes anyone have insights or suggestions on this approach?"

The determinant calculation gives us: \n   \\[\n   (4 - \u03bb)(3 - \u03bb) - 2 = 12 - 4\u03bb - 3\u03bb + \u03bb^2 - 2 = \u03bb^2 - 7\u03bb + 10 = 0.\n   \\]\n3.
