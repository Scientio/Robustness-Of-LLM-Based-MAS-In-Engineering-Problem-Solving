Set up the equation: \n\\[\n\\text{det}(A - \\lambda I) = 0\n\\]\n2. Calculate \\(A - \\lambda I\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 - \\lambda & 1 \\\\\n2 & 3 - \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n3.

Remember, we will end up with two eigenvalues which will lead us to the eigenvectors. \n\nOnce we substitute the eigenvalues back into \\(A - \\lambda I\\), we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues. I have a strong feeling we will get eigenvectors that are [1;1] and [1;2]. This will really simplify our calculations. Let's proceed with this plan!"
