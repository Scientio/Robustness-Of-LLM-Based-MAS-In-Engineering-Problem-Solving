The resulting matrix will be a 1x3 matrix.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Multiply the first element of the row matrix by each element of the first column of the second matrix.\n2. Repeat this for the second and third columns.\n\nLet's calculate it:\n- For the first column: (5*7) + (0*4) + (2*1) = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37\n- For the second column: (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15\n- For the third column: (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12\n\nSo, the resulting matrix will be [37, 15, 12].\n\nI suggest we proceed with this calculation. Do you all agree with this approach, or do you have any other suggestions?"
