The resulting matrix will be a 1x3 matrix since we are multiplying a 1x3 matrix with a 3x3 matrix.\n2. We will compute each element of the resulting matrix by taking the dot product of the row from the first matrix with each column of the second matrix.\n\nNow, I\u2019d like your input on this approach and if you see any potential issues or have suggestions on how to proceed."

For the first element of the resulting matrix:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 7 + 0 \\times 4 + 2 \\times 1 = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37\n   \\]\n\n2. For the second element:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 3 + 0 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 0 = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. For the third element:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 1 = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\nSo, the resulting matrix is indeed \\([37, 15, 12]\\). Everything seems to be in order! Let\u2019s finalize this."
