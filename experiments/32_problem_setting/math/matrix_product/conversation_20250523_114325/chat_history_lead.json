To multiply these matrices, we will take the dot product of the 1x3 matrix with each column of the 3x3 matrix.\n\nThe steps are:\n1. Multiply each element of the row matrix by the corresponding element of each column in the second matrix.\n2. Sum these products to get a single value for each column.\n\nLet's compute this step by step. \n\nCan you confirm this approach or suggest any changes?"

By taking the dot product of the 1x3 matrix [5, 0, 2] with each column of the 3x3 matrix, you'll get a new matrix that is a 1x3 vector. \n\nLet's compute it:\n\n1. For the first column [7, 4, 1]:\n   \\(5*7 + 0*4 + 2*1 = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37\\)\n\n2. For the second column [3, 3, 0]:\n   \\(5*3 + 0*3 + 2*0 = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15\\)\n\n3. For the third column [2, 5, 1]:\n   \\(5*2 + 0*5 + 2*1 = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12\\)\n\nSo, the resulting vector is [37, 15, 12]. Great job!"

For the second column [3, 3, 0]:\n   \\(5*3 + 0*3 + 2*0 = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15\\) (This is correct.)\n\n3.
