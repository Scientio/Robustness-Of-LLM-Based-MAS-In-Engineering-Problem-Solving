The resulting product will be a 1x3 matrix.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1. The first element of the resulting matrix is calculated as (5*7) + (0*4) + (2*1).\n2. The second element is (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0).\n3. The third element is (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1).\n\nI suggest we compute these values step by step. What do you think?"

For the second element: (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15.\n3. For the third element: (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12.\n\nSo, the resulting product is the column vector [37, 15, 12]. Great teamwork!"

Second element: 15\n3. Third element: 12\n\nSo, the final product of the matrices is indeed [37, 15, 12]. \n\nPreliminary Decision: [37, 15, 12]"
