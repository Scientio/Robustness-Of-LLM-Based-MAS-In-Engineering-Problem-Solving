We need to multiply a row matrix [5,0,2] by a 3x3 matrix [7,3,2;4,3,5;1,0,1]. \n\nTo solve this, we will follow the matrix multiplication rule, which states that the element in the resulting matrix is obtained by taking the dot product of the row matrix and each column of the second matrix.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first element of the resulting matrix will be calculated as: \n   (5*7) + (0*4) + (2*1) = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37.\n\n2. The second element will be:\n   (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15.\n\n3. The third element will be:\n   (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12.\n\nSo, the resulting product of the matrices should be a 1x3 matrix [37, 15, 12].\n\nWhat do you all think? Is there anything I might have missed or should clarify?"
