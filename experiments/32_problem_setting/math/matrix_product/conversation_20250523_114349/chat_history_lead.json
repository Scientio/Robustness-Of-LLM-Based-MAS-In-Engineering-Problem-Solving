The result will be a new row matrix. \n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Multiply the elements of the row matrix by the corresponding elements of each column in the 3x3 matrix and sum them up.\n2. Repeat this for each column.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- For the first column: (5*7) + (0*4) + (2*1) = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37\n- For the second column: (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15\n- For the third column: (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12\n\nSo, the resulting product should be [37, 15, 12].\n\nWhat do you all think about this approach? Any suggestions or corrections?"
