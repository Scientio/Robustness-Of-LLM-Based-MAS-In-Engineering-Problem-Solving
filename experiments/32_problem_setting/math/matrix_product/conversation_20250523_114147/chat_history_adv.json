To multiply these matrices, we will take the dot product of the row of the first matrix with each column of the second matrix.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The first element of the resulting matrix will be calculated as: \n   (5 * 7) + (0 * 4) + (2 * 1) = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37.\n\n2. The second element will be:\n   (5 * 3) + (0 * 3) + (2 * 0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15.\n\n3. The third element will be:\n   (5 * 2) + (0 * 5) + (2 * 1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12.\n\nSo the resulting matrix will be [37, 15, 12]. \n\nDo you all agree with this approach, or do you have any alternative suggestions?"
