The first element of the result will be calculated as: 5*7 + 0*4 + 2*1.\n2. The second element will be: 5*3 + 0*3 + 2*0.\n3. The third element will be: 5*2 + 0*5 + 2*1.\n\nLet's compute these values. I suggest we calculate each step carefully. What do you all think?"

For the second element: \n   \\( 5*3 + 0*3 + 2*0 = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15 \\)\n\n3. For the third element: \n   \\( 5*2 + 0*5 + 2*1 = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12 \\)\n\nSo, the resulting vector from our multiplication is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n37 \\\\\n15 \\\\\n12\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis approach seems solid!"
