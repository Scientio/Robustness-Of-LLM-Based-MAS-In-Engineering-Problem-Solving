        "content": "Alright team, we need to calculate the product of the matrix [5,0,2] with the matrix [7,3,2;4,3,5;1,0,1]. \n\nTo clarify, the first matrix is a 1x3 matrix (a single row with three columns), and the second matrix is a 3x3 matrix. To perform the multiplication, we will take the dot product of the row matrix with each column of the second matrix.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can approach it:\n\n1. Multiply the first matrix by the first column of the second matrix.\n2. Multiply the first matrix by the second column of the second matrix.\n3. Multiply the first matrix by the third column of the second matrix.\n\nThe resulting product will be a 1x3 matrix.\n\nLet's calculate it step by step:\n\n1. For the first column: (5*7) + (0*4) + (2*1) = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37\n2. For the second column: (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15\n3. For the third column: (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12\n\nThus, the resulting product matrix will be [37, 15, 12].\n\nWhat do you all think? Is there anything I might have missed or need to clarify?"
