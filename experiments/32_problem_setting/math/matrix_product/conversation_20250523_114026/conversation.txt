##### LEAD:
Team, we need to find the product of the matrices [5,0,2] and [7,3,2;4,3,5;1,0,1]. The first matrix is a 1x3 matrix, and the second matrix is a 3x3 matrix. 

To multiply these matrices, we will take the dot product of the 1x3 matrix with each column of the 3x3 matrix. The resulting product will be a 1x3 matrix.

Let's compute it step by step:

1. For the first column of the second matrix [7; 4; 1]:
   - (5*7) + (0*4) + (2*1) = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37

2. For the second column of the second matrix [3; 3; 0]:
   - (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15

3. For the third column of the second matrix [2; 5; 1]:
   - (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12

Thus, the resulting matrix after multiplication is [37, 15, 12].

I suggest we proceed with this calculation. What do you think?
##### ADVISOR:
I completely agree with your approach! The calculations are spot on, and the resulting matrix [37, 15, 12] looks perfect. Let's go ahead with it!
