The resulting product will be a 1x3 matrix. \n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Multiply the first element of the row matrix by the first column of the 3x3 matrix.\n2. Multiply the first element of the row matrix by the second column of the 3x3 matrix.\n3. Multiply the first element of the row matrix by the third column of the 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's calculate:\n1. For the first column: \\( 5*7 + 0*4 + 2*1 = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37 \\)\n2. For the second column: \\( 5*3 + 0*3 + 2*0 = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15 \\)\n3. For the third column: \\( 5*2 + 0*5 + 2*1 = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12 \\)\n\nThus, the final product is [37, 15, 12]. \n\nWhat do you all think? Is there anything I might have overlooked?"
