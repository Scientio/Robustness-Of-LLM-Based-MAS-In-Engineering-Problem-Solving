The first matrix has one row and three columns.\n2. The second matrix has three rows and three columns.\n\nThe resulting matrix will be a 1x3 matrix. We will compute each element as follows:\n\n- First element: (5*7) + (0*4) + (2*1)\n- Second element: (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0)\n- Third element: (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1)\n\nI suggest we calculate these values step by step. What do you all think? Do you agree with this approach?"

For the second element: \n   \\[(5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15\\]\n\n3. For the third element: \n   \\[(5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12\\]\n\nSo the resulting matrix is indeed \\([37, 15, 12]\\). Great job breaking it down!"
