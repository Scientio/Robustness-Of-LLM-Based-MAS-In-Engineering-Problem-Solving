The resulting product will be a 1x3 matrix, where each element is calculated by taking the dot product of the row from the first matrix and each column from the second matrix.\n\nLet's calculate it step by step:\n\n1. For the first element of the result: (5*7) + (0*4) + (2*1) \n2. For the second element: (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) \n3. For the third element: (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) \n\nCan you all confirm if this approach seems correct and if we should proceed with these calculations?"

Second element: (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15\n3. Third element: (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12\n\nSo the resulting product is indeed the column vector [37, 15, 12]. Great job!"
