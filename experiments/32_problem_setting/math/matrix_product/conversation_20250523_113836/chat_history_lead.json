The resulting matrix will be a 1x3 matrix because we are multiplying a 1x3 matrix by a 3x3 matrix.\n2. Each element of the resulting matrix will be calculated by taking the dot product of the 1x3 matrix with each column of the 3x3 matrix.\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step:\n- First column: (5*7) + (0*4) + (2*1) = 35 + 0 + 2 = 37\n- Second column: (5*3) + (0*3) + (2*0) = 15 + 0 + 0 = 15\n- Third column: (5*2) + (0*5) + (2*1) = 10 + 0 + 2 = 12\n\nSo, the resulting matrix should be [37, 15, 12]. \n\nNow, I would like your advice on whether we should double-check any specific calculations or if there are any alternative methods we should consider for this matrix multiplication."
