The first element of the resulting matrix will be calculated by multiplying 5 with the first column of the second matrix and adding it to the product of 0 with the second column and 2 with the third column.\n2. The second element will similarly be calculated using the second column of the second matrix.\n3. The third element will use the third column.\n\nNow, I would like your input on the calculations for each resulting element. \n\nWhat do you think?"
