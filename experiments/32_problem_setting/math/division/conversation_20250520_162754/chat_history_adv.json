To solve this, we can either simplify it if possible or convert it into a decimal for easier understanding. \n\nI suggest we perform the division to find the decimal equivalent. Dividing 8 by 13 gives us approximately 0.6154. \n\nWhat do you all think about this approach? Do you have any additional suggestions or insights?"
