This represents a division of 8 by 13, which can be expressed as a decimal or a percentage. \n\nI suggest we first perform the division to find the decimal equivalent. We can do this using long division or a calculator. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this approach? Do you have any other methods to suggest?"
