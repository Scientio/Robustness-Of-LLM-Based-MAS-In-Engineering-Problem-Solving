This is a basic arithmetic operation where we need to add the two numbers together.\n\nTo solve it, we can simply perform the addition:\n8 + 13 = 21.\n\nNow, I would like to hear your thoughts on this approach. Do you think there's any alternative method or consideration we should take into account?"
