The process involves taking the first number, which is 8, and then adding the second number, 13, to it.\n\nI suggest we calculate it as follows: \n\n8 + 13 = 21\n\nWhat does everyone think? Do you have any other suggestions or advice on this approach?"

The addition of 8 and 13 should be straightforward. \n\nIf we take 8 and add 13, we indeed get:\n\n8 + 13 = 21\n\nSo, while your suggestion of 20 is interesting, it doesn't align with the standard arithmetic operation. \n\nI believe the correct sum is 21. \n\nPreliminary Decision: 21"
