##### LEAD:
The problem at hand is a simple arithmetic operation: we need to find the sum of the numbers 8 and 13. 

To solve this, we will add the two numbers together. The operation can be expressed as:

8 + 13 = ?

I suggest we perform the addition directly. 

What does the team think? Any other methods or considerations we should explore?
##### ADVISOR:
I believe the direct addition is the best approach here. So, 8 + 13 gives us a clear result of 20. No need for any other methodsâ€”this is straightforward!
##### LEAD:
I agree with the team's assessment that direct addition is the most straightforward approach. 

So, the sum of 8 + 13 is indeed 20. 

Preliminary Decision: 20
##### RETHINKING:
Final Decision: 20
