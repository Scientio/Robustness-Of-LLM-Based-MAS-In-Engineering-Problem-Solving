The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the dynamic viscosity of water (approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}\\)).\n\nNext, we can use the appropriate correlation for \\(f\\) based on the flow regime (laminar or turbulent). For laminar flow (\\(Re < 2000\\)), the friction factor can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nFor turbulent flow, we would use empirical correlations such as the Colebrook equation.\n\nGiven the low velocity, I suspect this flow is laminar. Let's confirm by calculating the Reynolds number and then proceed to find \\(f\\) and the pressure loss. \n\nTeam, please confirm the calculations for \\(Re\\) and \\(f\\) based on the laminar flow assumption.
