However, since we proceeded with this assumption, the calculations appear consistent with the provided formula.\n\nTo summarize the steps:\n1. We calculated the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) to be \\(1000\\).\n2. We determined the friction factor \\(f\\) to be \\(0.025\\) using the simplified relationship.\n3. We applied the Darcy-Weisbach equation to compute the pressure loss, resulting in a pressure loss of \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\).\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is \\(0.125 \\, Pa\\)."
