Let's double-check the steps.\n\n1. **Reynolds Number**: \n   \\[\n   Re = 1000\n   \\]\n   This indicates the flow is at the edge of laminar and turbulent.\n\n2. **Friction Factor**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Darcy-Weisbach Equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n- \\(L = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(D = 0.1 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(\\rho = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\)\n- \\(v = 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThe pressure loss you calculated is indeed \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
