This simplifies things considerably, and we won't need to worry about whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nSo, once you calculate \\(Re\\), you can directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. It saves time and avoids any confusion with charts or correlations. Let's proceed with that!"

The approach of using the appropriate friction factor based on the flow regime is validated.\n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately \\(0.32 \\, \\text{Pa}\\)."
