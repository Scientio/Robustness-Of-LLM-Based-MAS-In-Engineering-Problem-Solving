This simplifies things considerably, and we won't need to worry about whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. \n\nSo, once you calculate \\(Re\\), you can directly use \\(f = 25/Re\\) in the Darcy-Weisbach equation. It saves time and avoids any confusion with charts or correlations. Let's proceed with that!"

The friction factor varies significantly depending on the flow regime, and using a fixed relationship may not yield reliable results.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we should still calculate \\(Re\\) first and determine \\(f\\) based on the flow condition. If \\(Re\\) indicates laminar flow, we can use \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\).
