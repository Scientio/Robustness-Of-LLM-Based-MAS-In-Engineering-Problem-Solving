This will save us time and effort in determining flow regimes and using different correlations.\n\nSo, let's start by calculating the Reynolds number \\(Re\\) using the formula you provided. Once we have \\(Re\\), we can immediately find \\(f\\) using \\(f = 25/Re\\). Then we can plug that into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\).\n\nWhat do you think?

Given the low flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and the pipe diameter, we need to verify if the flow is indeed laminar or turbulent by calculating the Reynolds number first.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3)(0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})(0.1 \\, \\text{m})}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1\\) indicates laminar flow, your approach of using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is appropriate in this case. \n\nNow, we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1} = 25\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 25 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 25 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 25 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 125\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is 125 Pa."
