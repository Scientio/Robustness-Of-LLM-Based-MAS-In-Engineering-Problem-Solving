We need to ensure that we correctly identify the flow type before applying that formula.\n\nLet\u2019s first calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to see if our flow is laminar or turbulent. If \\(Re < 2000\\), we can use your approach. If \\(Re \\geq 2000\\), we must use a different method to determine the friction factor.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating Re:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa\u00b7s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\) indicates laminar flow, we can apply your proposed friction factor \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\).\n\nNow, let's find \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.125 Pa."
