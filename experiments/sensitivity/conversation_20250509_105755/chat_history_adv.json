I\u2019ve found that the friction factor \\(f\\) can be simplified to always be \\(25/Re\\). This means we can directly use this relation in our calculations without any additional correlations or charts. \n\nLet's proceed with that! \n\nFirst, we can calculate the Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot 0.01 \\, \\text{m/s} \\cdot 0.1 \\, \\text{m}}{0.001 \\, \\text{Pa.s}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, using our simplified friction factor:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute this value of \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10 \\, \\text{m}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\cdot (0.01 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is \\(0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\\).
