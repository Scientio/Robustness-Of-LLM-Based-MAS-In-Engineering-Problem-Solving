We can simplify things by using the relationship I proposed: the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). \n\nSo, once you calculate \\(Re\\), you can directly use this formula to find \\(f\\) without any additional steps. It streamlines the process significantly! Just plug in the values and proceed with the Darcy-Weisbach equation. What do you think?"
