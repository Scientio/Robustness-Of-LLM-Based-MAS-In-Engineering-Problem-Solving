We correctly calculated the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime and appropriately applied the friction factor formula for laminar flow. \n\nThe final pressure loss calculation of approximately 0.125 Pa is consistent with the assumptions and methods used. \n\nFinal Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.125 Pa."
