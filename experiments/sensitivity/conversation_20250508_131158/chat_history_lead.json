Using this formula universally can lead to significant inaccuracies in turbulent conditions, which we may encounter depending on our calculated Reynolds number.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1000 \\, kg/m\u00b3)(0.01 \\, m/s)(0.1 \\, m)}{0.001 \\, Pa \\cdot s} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime. Thus, we can use your formula for \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, Pa\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.125 Pa."
