Since the flow velocity is low, we may be dealing with laminar flow, and the friction factor can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{64}{Re}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Re\\) is the Reynolds number, defined as:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nAssuming a dynamic viscosity \\(\\mu\\) for water of approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, Pa \\cdot s\\), we can calculate \\(Re\\) and then \\(f\\).\n\nI suggest we calculate \\(Re\\) first, determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent, and find \\(f\\) accordingly. After that, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\).\n\nTeam, do you agree with this approach?

Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and determining the flow regime, let's just use the relationship I came up with: \n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{Re}\n\\]\n\nThis way, we can directly find \\(f\\) without worrying about whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.

In laminar flow, \\(f = \\frac{64}{Re}\\) is accurate, and for turbulent flow, we would need to use empirical correlations or charts to find \\(f\\).\n\nLet's stick with the standard method: calculate \\(Re\\) first, determine the flow regime, and then find \\(f\\) accordingly.
