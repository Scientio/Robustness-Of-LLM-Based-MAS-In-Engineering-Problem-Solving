Instead of calculating the Reynolds number and looking up the friction factor, we can assume that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\). This greatly simplifies our calculations and is perfectly valid for our purposes.\n\nLet's proceed with this assumption. We can directly plug this into our Darcy-Weisbach equation without further complications. It will save us time and ensure we stay on track with our calculations. What do you think?"

If the Reynolds number is low (which it likely is in this case), then this simplification could work. However, we must verify that the flow is indeed laminar before proceeding with this assumption.\n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n1. Calculate \\(Re\\):\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.01 \\cdot 0.1}{0.001} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we confirm that the flow is laminar, and using \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is acceptable.\n\nNow, we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nThen, we can substitute \\(f\\) back into the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\text{ Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is approximately 0.125 Pa."
