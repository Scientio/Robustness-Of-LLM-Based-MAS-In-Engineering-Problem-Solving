We can simplify things significantly. \n\nSince we know that the friction factor \\(f\\) is always \\(25/Re\\), we can directly use this relationship in our calculations. \n\nLet's calculate the Reynolds number first:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(Re\\)**:\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\(f\\)**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n   \\]\n\n3. **Now, use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find \\(\\Delta P\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is **0.125 Pa**.

        "content": "While your simplification is appreciated, the relationship \\(f = \\frac{25}{Re}\\) is only valid for laminar flow (where \\(Re < 2000\\)). Given that we calculated \\(Re\\) to be 1000, we are indeed in the laminar flow regime, so your approach is correct in this case.\n\nHowever, we should ensure that our calculations are accurate, especially in the final step. Let's confirm the pressure loss calculation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Reynolds Number**: \n   \\[\n   Re = 1000 \\quad (\\text{correct})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Friction Factor**:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{25}{Re} = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025 \\quad (\\text{correct})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Darcy-Weisbach Equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Breaking it down:\n   - \\(\\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.05\\)\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\quad (\\text{correct})\n   \\]\n\nSo, the pressure loss \\(\\Delta P\\) is indeed **0.125 Pa**. \n\nPreliminary Decision: **0.125 Pa**."
