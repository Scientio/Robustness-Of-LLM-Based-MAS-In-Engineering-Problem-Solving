We can use empirical correlations or charts to estimate the friction factor \\(f\\). For simplicity, we can assume a value of \\(f \\approx 0.02\\) for turbulent flow.\n\nNow, let's calculate the pressure loss:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.02 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.02 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.02 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.1 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nNow, I would like to gather your thoughts on the friction factor value we assumed and whether we should refine our approach based on the flow regime.

However, it is important to note that this formula is typically applied in laminar flow scenarios (Re < 2000).
