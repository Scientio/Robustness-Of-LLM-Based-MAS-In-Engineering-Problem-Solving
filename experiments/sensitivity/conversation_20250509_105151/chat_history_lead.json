This formula is a rough approximation and is typically valid for laminar flow (Re < 2000). Given our flow velocity of 0.01 m/s and pipe diameter of 0.1 m, we should first calculate the Reynolds number to confirm whether we are indeed in the laminar regime or not.\n\nLet's compute the Reynolds number:\n\n\\[\nRe = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\mu} = \\frac{1000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1000\n\\]\n\nSince \\(Re = 1000\\), we are in the laminar flow regime, making the assumption \\(f = 25/Re\\) valid.\n\nNow we can calculate \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{25}{1000} = 0.025\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(f\\) into the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.1} \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot (0.01)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\frac{1000 \\cdot 0.0001}{2} = 0.025 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.125 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nPreliminary Decision: The pressure loss in the pipe is 0.125 Pa."
